            "Response:\n",
            "### 1. Direct Answer\n",
            "To monitor Redis memory usage effectively, you should regularly check Redis memory metrics, especially the `used_memory`, `maxmemory`, and `memory_stats`. Additionally, monitor the `redis_evicted_keys_total` metric to detect memory saturation issues. Use Redis commands like `INFO MEMORY` and `MEMORY STATS`, and set up Prometheus/ Grafana dashboards for continuous monitoring.\n",

            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 1: Access Redis CLI\n",
            "- Connect to your Redis instance using `redis-cli`:\n",
            "  ```bash\n",
            "  redis-cli -h <redis-host> -p <port>\n",
            "  ```\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 2: Check Basic Memory Usage\n",
            "- Run the `INFO MEMORY` command:\n",
            "  ```bash\n",
            "  INFO MEMORY\n",
            "  ```\n",
            "- Review the output for:\n",
            "  - `used_memory`: current memory used by Redis (bytes)\n",
            "  - `maxmemory`: configured maximum memory limit (bytes)\n",
            "  - `maxmemory_policy`: eviction policy in use\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 3: Review Memory Statistics\n",
            "- Run the `MEMORY STATS` command:\n",
            "  ```bash\n",
            "  MEMORY STATS\n",
            "  ```\n",
            "- Analyze detailed memory breakdowns, including fragmentation and allocator info.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 4: Monitor Evictions and Saturation\n",
            "- Check the total number of evicted keys:\n",
            "  ```bash\n",
            "  INFO STATS\n",
            "  ```\n",
            "  Look for `evicted_keys` or use:\n",

            "  redis-cli info stats | grep evicted_keys\n",
            "  ```\n",
            "- Alternatively, monitor the `redis_evicted_keys_total` metric via Prometheus if configured.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 5: Set Up Continuous Monitoring\n",
            "- Use Prometheus to scrape Redis metrics, especially:\n",
            "  - `redis_memory_used_bytes`\n",
            "  - `redis_memory_max_bytes`\n",
            "  - `redis_evicted_keys_total`\n",
            "- Create Grafana dashboards to visualize memory usage over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 6: Special Handling for Max Memory\n",
            "- Monitor the proportion of `used_memory` relative to `maxmemory`:\n",
            "  ```plaintext\n",
            "  Memory Usage Ratio = used_memory / maxmemory\n",
            "  ```\n",
            "- Alert if this ratio approaches 1 (e.g., > 0.8), indicating high memory utilization.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 7: Enable Latency Monitoring (Optional)\n",
            "- To diagnose latency issues related to memory operations, enable latency monitoring:\n",
            "  ```bash\n",
            "  CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100\n",
            "  ```\n",
            "- Use `LATENCY DOCTOR` for diagnostics:\n",

[- [4. Troubleshooting](#4-troubleshooting)\\n# Provisioning Redis Cluster\\nThis document outlines the steps for provisioning a Redis Cluster. Former attempts are documented here:\\n- [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256)\\n- [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358)\\n## Setting up instances\\n[Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances)\\nFirst, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely:\\n- `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd`\\n- `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1`\\n- `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag`\\n- `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`)\\n- `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag`\\n- `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`.\\n- `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\nWhen configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application.\\nE.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes.\\n**Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand.\\n### 1. Generate Redis passwords\\n[Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\nGenerate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using:\\n```\\nfor I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n```\\nUpdate both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master):\\n```\\n./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n```\\nUpdate the JSON payload to include the new instance details:\\n```\\n{\\n...,\\n\"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n\"redis_conf\": {\\n\"masteruser\": \"replica\",\\n\"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n\"user\": [\\n\"default off\",\\n\"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n\"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\",\\n\"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\",\\n\"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\"\\n]\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n```\\nDo the same for\\n```\\n./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n```\\nModify the existing JSON\\n```\\n{\\n\"redis_exporter\": {\\n\"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n\"env\": {\\n\"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\"\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n```, mv data.json.tmp data.json\\nvault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\nrm data.json\\nOR\\nglsh vault edit-secret chef env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets\\n#  Add the following object in .\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override :\\n#  \"<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>\": {\\n#    \"password\": <RAILS_REDACTED>\\n#  }\\n```\\nUpdate roles/-base.json with the relevant connection details. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3546).\\n### 2. Verification of config in a VM\\n[Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm)\\nCheck the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference.\\n```\\n[ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME>\\n=> \"PONG\"\\n[ gstg ] production>\\n```\\n### 3. Configure Gitlab Rails\\n[Section titled “3. Configure Gitlab Rails”](#3-configure-gitlab-rails)\\na. Update secret\\n```\\nvault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED>\\n```\\nFor example,\\n```\\nvault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\n======================== Secret Path ========================\\nk8s/data/env/gprd/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-rails\\n======= Metadata =======\\nKey                Value\\n---                -----\\ncreated_time       2023-03-18T00:33:29.790293426Z\\ncustom_metadata    <nil>\\ndeletion_time      n/a\\ndestroyed          false\\nversion            1\\n====== Data ======\\nKey         Value\\n---         -----\\npassword    <RAILS_REDACTED>\\n```\\nNote the version of the password in `vault kv get` and make sure it tallies with the external secret definition in [k8s-workload](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/master/releases/gitlab-external-secrets/values/values.yaml.gotmpl):\\n```\\ngitlab-redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails-credential-v1:\\nrefreshInterval: 0\\nsecretStoreName: gitlab-secrets\\ntarget:\\ncreationPolicy: Owner\\ndeletionPolicy: Delete\\ndata:\\n- remoteRef:\\nkey: env/{{ $env }}/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\nproperty: password\\nversion: \"1\"\\nsecretKey: password\\n```\\nNote that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets).\\nb. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly.\\nEither add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2753).\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n#### No metrics on dashboard\\n[Section titled “No metrics on dashboard”](#no-metrics-on-dashboard), ```\\nUse the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..m}` where `n` is the number of shards and `m` is the number of instances per shard.\\n```\\nfor i in {01,02,03}-{02,03}; do\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\\\n$DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\\\n$DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379\\nsleep 2\\ndone\\n```\\nUse the following command, to assign the replicas within each shard.

Former attempts are documented here: - [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256) - [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358) ## Setting up instances [Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances) First, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely: - `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd` - `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1` - `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag` - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`) - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag` - `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`. - `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) When configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application. E.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes. **Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand. ### 1. Generate Redis passwords [Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords) Generate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using: ``` for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done ``` Update both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master): ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV> ``` Update the JSON payload to include the new instance details: ``` { ..., \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"redis_conf\": { \"masteruser\": \"replica\", \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"user\": [ \"default off\", \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\", \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\", \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\" ] } } } ``` Do the same for ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV> ``` Modify the existing JSON ``` { \"redis_exporter\": { \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"env\": { \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\" } } } } ``` ### 2. Create Chef roles [Section titled “2. Create Chef roles”](#2-create-chef-roles) Set the new chef roles and add the new role to the list of gitlab-redis roles in -infra-prometheus-server role. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3494). ### 3. Provision VMs [Section titled “3. Provision VMs”](#3-provision-vms) Provision the VMs via the generic-stor/google terraform module. This is done in the [config-mgmt project in the ops environment](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/). An example MR can be found [here](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5811). After the MR is merged and applied, check the VM state via: ``` gcloud compute instances list --project <GCP_PROJECT> | grep 'redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>' ``` You need to wait for the initial chef-client run to complete. One way to check is to tail the serial port output to check when the initial run is completed. An example: ``` gcloud compute --project=<GCP_PROJECT> instances tail-serial-port-output redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV> --zone us-east1-{c/b/d} ``` ### 4. Initialising the cluster [Section titled “4. Initialising the cluster”](#4-initialising-the-cluster) a. SSH into one of the instance: ``` ssh redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV>.c.<GCP_PROJECT>.internal ``` b. Run the following: ``` export ENV=<ENV> export PROJECT=<GCP_PROJECT> export DEPLOYMENT=redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE> ``` c. Use the following command to connect the master-nodes and initialise a working cluster. Add more shard FQDN where necessary. e.g. `$DEPLOYMENT-shard-<shard_number>-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379`. ``` sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster create \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-02-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-03-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 ``` Use the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..m}` where `n` is the number of shards and `m` is the number of instances per shard. ``` for i in {01,02,03}-{02,03}; do sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 sleep 2 done ``` Use the following command, to assign the replicas within each shard. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..n}` where necessary depending on the cluster-size. ``` for i in {01,02,03}; do for j in {02,03}; do node_id=\"$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster nodes | grep $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal | awk '{ print $1 }')\"; sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-$j-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal \\ cluster replicate $node_id done done ``` ### 5. Validation [Section titled “5. Validation”](#5-validation) Wait for a few seconds as the nodes need time to gossip. Check the status via: ``` $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal:6379 (9b0828e3...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.3:6379 (ac03fcee...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.4:6379 (f8341afd...) -> 0 keys | 5462 slots | 2 slaves. [OK] 0 keys in 3 masters. 0.00 keys per slot on average. $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster info | head -n7 cluster_state:ok cluster_slots_assigned:16384 cluster_slots_ok:16384 cluster_slots_pfail:0 cluster_slots_fail:0 cluster_known_nodes:9 cluster_size:3 ``` ## Configuring the applications [Section titled “Configuring the applications”](#configuring-the-applications) ### 1. Configure console instances [Section titled “1. Configure console instances”](#1-configure-console-instances) a. Proxy and authenticate to Hashicorp Vault: ``` glsh vault proxy export VAULT_PROXY_ADDR=\"socks5://localhost:18200\" glsh vault login ``` ``` vault kv get -format=json chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets | jq '.data.data' > data.json cat data.json | jq --arg PASSWORD <RAILS_REDACTED> '.\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>.password = $PASSWORD' > data.json.tmp diff -u data.json data.json.tmp mv data.json.tmp data.json vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json rm data.json OR glsh vault edit-secret chef env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets # Add the following object in .\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override : # \"<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>\": { # \"password\": <RAILS_REDACTED> # } ``` Update roles/-base.json with the relevant connection details.

Direct Answer\\nHashicorp Vault is used to securely store, manage, and rotate Redis cluster passwords. It acts as a centralized secrets management system, ensuring that Redis credentials are kept confidential, versioned, and easily retrievable by authorized systems and personnel, thereby enhancing security and operational control.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### Step 1: Generate Redis Passwords\\n- Generate four secure passwords (`REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, `CONSOLE_REDACTED`) using:\\n  ```\\n  for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n  ```\\n- These passwords are then stored securely in Vault.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Update Vault Secrets for Redis Cluster and Exporter\\n- Use `gkms-vault-edit` to update the secrets:\\n  ```\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n  ```\\n- Modify the JSON payload to include the new passwords:\\n  ```json\\n  {\\n    ...,\\n    \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n      \"redis_conf\": {\\n        \"masteruser\": \"replica\",\\n        \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n        \"user\": [\\n          \"default off\",\\n          \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n          \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\",\\n          \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\",\\n          \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\"\\n        ]\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n  ```\\n- Similarly, update the `redis-exporter` secret:\\n  ```\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n  ```\\n  with:\\n  ```json\\n  {\\n    \"redis_exporter\": {\\n      \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n        \"env\": {\\n          \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\"\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n  ```\\n\\n#### Step 3: Store Secrets in Vault KV\\n- Save the updated JSON data:\\n  ```\\n  mv data.json.tmp data.json\\n  vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n  rm data.json\\n  ```\\n- Alternatively, use:\\n  ```\\n  glsh vault edit-secret chef env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets\\n  ```\\n\\n#### Step 4: Link Secrets to Application Configuration\\n- Add the password object in the application's `gitlab.rb` override:\\n  ```json\\n  \"<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>\": {\\n    \"password\": <RAILS_REDACTED>\\n  }\\n  ```\\n- Update the relevant roles and configuration files as per the runbook instructions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- Generate passwords:\\n  ```\\n  for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n  ```\\n- Update Vault secrets:\\n  ```\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n  ```\\n- Store secrets:\\n  ```\\n  vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n  ```\\n- Verify in GitLab Rails console:\\n  ```\\n  Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with { |c| c.ping }  # Replace with your RAILS_CLASS_NAME\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Security:** Vault ensures secrets are encrypted at rest and access is controlled via permissions.\\n- **Versioning:** Secrets are versioned; when rotating passwords, follow the safe rollout procedures.\\n- **Automation:** Use the provided commands and scripts to automate secret updates, reducing manual errors.\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure Vault access permissions and `gkms-vault-edit` tooling are correctly configured.\\n- **Caution:** Always verify the secrets are correctly stored and referenced in application configs before deploying.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis process centralizes Redis credentials management, improves security posture, and simplifies secret rotation workflows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hashicorp Vault is used to generate and store Redis passwords, which are then updated in the vault secrets and used for configuring Redis cluster instances and related services.      0.620690          0.975658                1.0        1.000000            0.419508                    0.0\n",

It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability). It’s not a full DBMS with\\nguaranteed write semantics (and performance implications to match), but it is sufficiently persistent that there wouldn’t, Note that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets).\\nb. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly.\\nEither add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2753).\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4.

Verification of config in a VM [Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm) Check the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference. ``` [ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME> => \"PONG\" [ gstg ] production> ``` ### 3. Configure Gitlab Rails [Section titled “3. Configure Gitlab Rails”](#3-configure-gitlab-rails) a. Update secret ``` vault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED> ``` For example, ``` vault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails ======================== Secret Path ======================== k8s/data/env/gprd/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-rails ======= Metadata ======= Key Value --- ----- created_time 2023-03-18T00:33:29.790293426Z custom_metadata <nil> deletion_time n/a destroyed false version 1 ====== Data ====== Key Value --- ----- password <RAILS_REDACTED> ``` Note the version of the password in `vault kv get` and make sure it tallies with the external secret definition in [k8s-workload](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/master/releases/gitlab-external-secrets/values/values.yaml.gotmpl): ``` gitlab-redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails-credential-v1: refreshInterval: 0 secretStoreName: gitlab-secrets target: creationPolicy: Owner deletionPolicy: Delete data: - remoteRef: key: env/{{ $env }}/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails property: password version: \"1\" secretKey: password ``` Note that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets). b. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly. Either add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2753). ### 4. Troubleshooting [Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting) #### No metrics on dashboard [Section titled “No metrics on dashboard”](#no-metrics-on-dashboard) This was encountered when provisioning the [production instance of redis-cluster-chat-cache](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358#note_1406105979). To resolve this, run chef-repo on Prometheus with: ``` knife ssh roles:gprd-infra-prometheus-server \"sudo chef-client\" ``` [Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis/provisioning-redis-cluster.md) [Previous Memory space analysis with cupcake-rdb](/redis/memory-space-analysis-cupcake-rdb/) [Next Troubleshooting](/redis/redis/)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ### 1. Direct Answer\\nNo, GitLab is not used for managing Redis configurations directly in the infrastructure setup. Redis configurations are managed through configuration files (e.g., `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf`) and controlled via GitLab's Omnibus `gitlab-ctl` commands, but the actual configuration management is not handled by GitLab itself. Instead, GitLab provides runbook procedures and scripts to modify Redis settings, and the infrastructure team manages the deployment and updates outside of GitLab's core application.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n**To manage Redis configurations in the GitLab infrastructure:**\\n\\n1. **Access the Redis configuration file:**\\n   - Located at `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf`.\\n\\n2. **Modify configuration parameters:**\\n   - For example, to set `client-output-buffer-limit`:\\n     - Convert human-readable sizes (e.g., 4GB) into bytes.\\n     - Update the config file manually or via automation.\\n\\n3. **Apply configuration changes:**\\n   - Use the Redis CLI to set runtime configurations:\\n     ```bash\\n     REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set <parameter> \"<value>\"\\n     ```\\n   - Example for `client-output-buffer-limit`:\\n     ```bash\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set client-output-buffer-limit \"slave 4294967296 4294967296 0\"\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Restart Redis if needed:**\\n   - If configuration changes require a restart:\\n     ```bash\\n     sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n     ```\\n\\n5. **Use runbook procedures for troubleshooting or specific tasks:**\\n   - Follow documented steps for starting, stopping, or troubleshooting Redis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **To set a Redis configuration at runtime:**\\n  ```bash\\n  REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set <parameter> \"<value>\"\\n  ```\\n- **To restart Redis:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Configuration Management:** Redis configs are managed via files and runbook procedures, not directly through GitLab's interface.\\n- **Security:** Always ensure you have the correct `masterauth` password when executing Redis CLI commands.\\n- **Persistence:** Changes to runtime configs are temporary unless written to the config file; persistent changes require editing the config file and restarting Redis.\\n- **Automation:** For bulk or automated updates, consider using Chef or other automation tools as per the runbook.\\n- **Caution:** Be careful when modifying Redis configs; incorrect settings can cause Redis to fail or behave unexpectedly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nWhile GitLab provides the infrastructure and runbook documentation for managing Redis, it does not directly handle Redis configuration management. Instead, configurations are applied via standard Redis commands, configuration files, and controlled through the runbook procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The context mentions GitLab in relation to verifying configuration in a VM, updating secrets, and configuring GitLab Rails, indicating that GitLab is used for managing redis configurations within the infrastructure setup.      0.823529          0.923224                1.0        1.000000            0.364131                    0.0\n",

                    ### 1. Direct Answer\\nAn SSL Certificate (Secure Sockets Layer Certificate) is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and enables encrypted communication between the server and clients. It ensures data privacy, integrity, and security during data transmission over the internet.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook Procedures)\\n\\n**Note:** The runbook documentation provided does not explicitly detail SSL certificate procedures, but general best practices and typical steps are outlined below.\\n\\n#### Step 1: Understand the Purpose of SSL Certificates\\n- Verify whether you need an SSL certificate for your domain or service.\\n- Determine if you will use a managed service (e.g., AWS Managed Certificates) or generate your own.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Obtain an SSL Certificate\\n- For managed certificates:\\n  - Refer to [AWS Managed Certificates](https://about.gitlab.com/certificates/aws/) for instructions.\\n- For self-managed certificates:\\n  - Generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) using OpenSSL or your preferred tool.\\n  - Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA) to obtain the certificate.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Install the SSL Certificate\\n- Upload the certificate files (certificate, private key, CA bundle) to your server.\\n- Configure your web server or load balancer to use the SSL certificate.\\n\\n#### Step 4: Configure Your Web Server or Load Balancer\\n- Update the server configuration to enable SSL/TLS.\\n- Ensure the correct paths to the certificate files are specified.\\n- Restart the server or load balancer to apply changes.\\n\\n#### Step 5: Verify the SSL Certificate\\n- Use tools like `openssl` or online SSL checkers to verify proper installation.\\n- Confirm that the certificate is valid, not expired, and correctly chained.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n\\n**Generating a CSR with OpenSSL:**\\n```bash\\nopenssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout yourdomain.key -out yourdomain.csr\\n```\\n\\n**Installing Certificate (example for Nginx):**\\n```nginx\\nserver {\\n    listen 443 ssl;\\n    server_name yourdomain.com;\\n\\n    ssl_certificate /path/to/your_certificate.crt;\\n    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your_private.key;\\n    ssl_trusted_certificate /path/to/ca_bundle.crt;\\n\\n    # other configurations\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Restarting Nginx:**\\n```bash\\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have access to your server or load balancer configuration.\\n- **Security:** Keep your private key secure; never share it.\\n- **Renewal:** SSL certificates typically expire after 90 days to 1 year; set reminders for renewal.\\n- **Managed Certificates:** Using AWS or other cloud provider managed certificates simplifies renewal and management.\\n- **Compliance:** Follow your organization’s security policies and best practices for certificate management.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nAn SSL certificate is essential for securing data in transit. Obtain it via a CA or managed service, install it on your server, configure your web server or load balancer accordingly, and verify proper setup to ensure secure communication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           SSL Certificate Expiring or Expired is mentioned in the context, indicating it is a certificate that may be nearing or past its expiration date, which is relevant for maintaining secure connections.      0.000000          0.791588                0.0        0.000000            0.740872                    0.0\n",

“Logging”](#logging) - [system](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/a10c2cd2b710f9eb65b13b9a2a328d51) The TraceChunks redis instances is a distinct redis cluster for storing CI build trace chunks immediately when received by the API from runners, before they are asynchronously (Ci::BuildTraceChunkFlushWorker) moved from there to ObjectStorage (as configured in .com; the database is another target option, but we don’t do that anymore). The data is important and persistent but transient (seconds to 10s of seconds normally, probably not minutes, definitely not hours, unless something has gone horribly wrong). This was split because as found in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327469#note_556531587> these trace chunks were (at the time) responsible for about 60% of the network throughput by bytes on the persistent redis, and 16% of the Redis calls, and it is a distinctive enough workload/usage pattern that splitting it out was deemed a good thing. Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters) Single threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then) The usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> ) Data is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable. Uses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover from. -]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ### 1.

[Section titled “Logging”](#logging) - system The Chat Cache Redis Cluster instances is a distinct Redis Cluster used by the GitLab Rails [chat features](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410521). Redis is in a 3-node-per-shard (single-primary/two-replica per shard) VM configuration, in cluster mode. The node count will start off at 3 but will increase as we scale horizontally. Uses the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters.

Direct Answer:**\\n\\nConnecting to various services via Teleport simplifies multi-service management by providing secure, unified access to different infrastructure components—such as PostgreSQL, Patroni clusters, and Redis—through a centralized, role-based SSH gateway. This approach enhances security, streamlines access control, and allows SREs to perform administrative tasks, troubleshoot, and monitor multiple services without managing multiple SSH keys or network configurations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Ensure Teleport Access is Configured**\\n- Verify your Teleport user account has appropriate roles and permissions to access the desired services (PostgreSQL, Patroni, Redis).\\n- Confirm your Teleport client (`tsh`) is installed and configured.\\n\\n**Step 2: Connect to the Teleport Proxy**\\n- Use `tsh` to authenticate and connect:\\n  ```\\n  tsh login --proxy=<teleport-proxy-host> --user=<your-user>\\n  ```\\n- Authenticate via MFA if required.\\n\\n**Step 3: Access PostgreSQL and Patroni Clusters**\\n- To connect to a PostgreSQL or Patroni service:\\n  ```\\n  tsh ssh <service-hostname>\\n  ```\\n  - For example:\\n    ```\\n    tsh ssh patroni-sec\\n    ```\\n- This creates a secure SSH tunnel through Teleport, allowing you to run `psql` or other database tools locally, or connect directly via port forwarding.\\n\\n**Step 4: Access Redis Infrastructure**\\n- Similarly, connect to Redis services:\\n  ```\\n  tsh ssh redis\\n  ```\\n- For Redis on Kubernetes or specific Redis clusters, use the relevant hostname or service name.\\n\\n**Step 5: Perform Administrative or Troubleshooting Tasks**\\n- Once connected, execute commands:\\n  - For PostgreSQL:\\n    ```\\n    psql -h <localhost> -U <user> -d <database>\\n    ```\\n  - For Patroni:\\n    - Use Patroni REST API endpoints via `curl` or `patronictl`.\\n  - For Redis:\\n    ```\\n    redis-cli -h <localhost> -p <port>\\n    ```\\n- Use the established SSH tunnel or port forwarding to access services securely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands and Configurations:**\\n\\n- **Connecting via Teleport:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh login --proxy=<proxy-host> --user=<user>\\n  tsh ssh <service-hostname>\\n  ```\\n- **Port Forwarding Example (if needed):**\\n  ```\\n  tsh ssh --local-port=<local-port> --remote-port=<service-port> <service-hostname>\\n  ```\\n- **Accessing PostgreSQL:**\\n  ```\\n  psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p <local-port> -U <user> -d <database>\\n  ```\\n- **Accessing Redis:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p <local-port>\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n\\n- **Security:** Teleport enforces role-based access control, ensuring only authorized users can connect to sensitive services.\\n- **Multi-Service Access:** Teleport consolidates access points, reducing complexity and improving auditability.\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure your Teleport client is up-to-date and your user has the necessary roles assigned.\\n- **Troubleshooting:** If connection issues occur, verify your Teleport configuration, network policies, and that the services are reachable via Teleport.\\n- **Additional Context:** This setup aligns with runbook practices for managing Patroni, PostgreSQL, and Redis clusters securely and efficiently, leveraging Teleport’s secure access features.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nUsing Teleport as a unified access gateway allows SREs to securely connect to and manage multiple services—PostgreSQL, Patroni, Redis—via a single, centralized interface. This streamlines multi-service management, enhances security, and simplifies operational workflows.  Connecting to various services via Teleport enables secure and streamlined access to multiple infrastructure components, including PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters, by providing centralized authentication and access management. This facilitates troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintenance of these clusters within complex setups. In the context of Redis infrastructure, Teleport's ability to connect to diverse services ensures that engineers can efficiently manage Redis databases alongside PostgreSQL and Patroni, supporting high availability and performance. By enabling multi-service access through a unified platform, Teleport simplifies multi-hop workflows, allowing engineers to perform multi-layered operations—such as connecting to Redis clusters, then accessing PostgreSQL or Patroni clusters—without compromising security or efficiency.      1.000000          0.865242                1.0        1.000000            0.952650                    0.0\n",
            "5  How do migration procedures for Redis sharding, including cluster setup and reconfiguration, relate to handling Redis failover events and master switch logs in ensuring high availability and performance?                                                                                                                                                                          [```\\nKeep a check on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n```\\n- During and after migration, Redis clients will receive `redirections` to contact the new owner of keyslots. These are not errors themselves as Redis clients would update their internal mapping of `keyslot -> master` upon receiving redirection from server. The redirections will take time to taper off and will definitely be gone after a new deployment in the environment, as all pods will be rotated in that scenario and will start off with up-to-date keyslot mapping.\\n## Key metrics to observe\\n[Section titled “Key metrics to observe”](#key-metrics-to-observe)\\nBelow is a list of some of the key metrics to check for:\\n- Redis service error ratio e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?from=now-6h&orgId=1&to=now&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=3422679610)\\n- Redis Cluster Slots Failed e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?orgId=1&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=115&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- Redirections for the clients e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?orgId=1&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=117&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis/scaling-redis-cluster.md)\\n[Previous\\nA survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab](/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres/)   [Next\\nRedis Cluster Cache Service](/redis-cluster-cache/), - (1) is FQDN of the Redis server\\n- (2) is the port number of Redis server\\n- **(3) is the node ID of the Redis instance** and required in resharding commands\\n- (4) is IP address of Redis instance\\n### 2. Calibrate the batch size for migration\\n[Section titled “2. Calibrate the batch size for migration”](#2-calibrate-the-batch-size-for-migration)\\nAt first, make a few migrations with incrementally increasing `BATCH_SIZE`, to determine a suitable size which does not cause large CPU/memory saturation spikes on the existing Redis instances and also is fast enough to complete migration within a few hours. Larger `BATCH_SIZE` will finish faster but will consume more CPU/memory due to concurrent read/writes and also compete with user requests, specially if keys have large values e.g. `set`, `list` or any other multi-value type data.\\nDuring previous migration in `redis-cluster-ratelimiting`, a `BATCH_SIZE` of 30 was used and moving 1365 keyslots took less than [5 seconds](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18061#note_1924076365).\\nVariables that need to be replaced in command below are:\\n- `FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **from** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `TO_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **to** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE`: number of keyslots to be migrated\\n- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of redis keys to be read and written from one master to another\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n# Trial runs to move some keyslots with batch size 30 to get time taken and its impact on CPU/Memory utilization\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nAt the same time, keep an eye on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. Also, note the time taken for migration of keyslots to estimate required time for completing the migration. If there is no impact on resources and time taken by migration is not reasonable, then try increasing the `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` to a workable number.\\n### 3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard\\n[Section titled “3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard”](#3-migrate-keys-from-existing-shards-to-new-shard)\\nWe have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster and a cluster with 3 shards have distribution like following:\\n1. First shard: 0-5460\\n2. Second shard: 5461-10922\\n3. Third shard: 10923-16383\\nIn this case, a new fourth shard will intake equal number of keyslots from all 3 existing shards, so 1365 keyslots from each (after round off).\\nOnce `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` have been determined, migrate the keyslots from each of existing shards to the new shard using:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nKeep a check on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```, ```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.\\n**resharding**: Migrating ownership of some hash slots from one shard to another. This is a dynamic online operation, where Redis keys are migrated between nodes. During a resharding operation, reads and writes to the keys being migrated are semantically safe but incur some extra overhead. Also, multi-key requests may temporarily fail during the transitional state. There are some documented corner cases where a failed resharding attempt must be manually completed. In our environments, because we do not intend to dynamically add/remove nodes, resharding will be a rare and planned event (e.g. when adding new nodes to the cluster for additional capacity), not a frequent automated background activity.\\nreplica migration - an optional feature that allows the cluster to dynamically reassign a replica from one master to another, to ensure all masters have at least N replicas. This feature aims to improve availability. However, it can counter-intuitively harm availability in either of 2 ways: it can lead to a master and its replicas being in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140700451)), or it can lead to accumulating a majority of masters in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140436657)). This feature can be disabled ([cluster-allow-replica-migration](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1662-L1668)) or tuned ([cluster-migration-barrier](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1642-L1660)). This is one of the topics to be addressed by scalability#2071.\\n## Observability\\n[Section titled “Observability”](#observability)\\nFor most parts, the Grafana dashboard is the same as a Sentinel-based Redis dashboard. The difference lies in:\\n1. Cluster-specific panel: This panel tracks the slot coverage and state of nodes in the cluster. The components are defined in [`libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/ff4ff9dd29ee417a4a7d1940178c3085cc25730f/libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet#L449).\\n2. `cluster_redirection` error SLI - tracks the rate of MOVED and ASK redirections. Redirections should only happen on (1) failover (requests are redirected to the new master), (2) resharding (requests are redirected to the new slot owner).\\nCross-slot errors are prevented on the application side and should not reach the servers except for pipelined operations during resharding. The volume can be tracked on logs under 2 groups of fields:\\n1. `json.redis_<functional shard>_allowed_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of

for and are running on non-cluster-based Redis)\\n2. `json.redis_<functional_shard>_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of cross-slot commands (not accounted for or running on Redis Cluster)\\n##

require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up.

[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition) Redis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done. In the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well. The other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system. ## Timing [Section titled “Timing”](#timing) The last two redis partitions that we have done took between 3 - 6 weeks to complete. The main factors that slow down or speed up the time required are the availability of reviewers for MRs, particularly for the application changes. In general, tamland forecasts capacity out approximately three months, which should give us adequate time to partition if required. ## Determining what to split off [Section titled “Determining what to split off”](#determining-what-to-split-off) This is more of an art than a science, as it will require some amount of knowledge of the usage patterns of the redis in question. We have documented how to [analyze memory usage](../redis#redis-memory-analyzer) as well as [keyspace usage and network traffic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md#keyspace-pattern-analysis), all of which can be combined to help determine what the largest chunk that makes logical sense to move is. ## Implementation [Section titled “Implementation”](#implementation) A lot of these processes are still a work in progress and will be modified based off of the results of [the epic to lessen sharding toil](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/886). ## Application changes [Section titled “Application changes”](#application-changes) - Create a new redis store class. It should inherit from `Gitlab::Redis::Wrapper`. Configure its `config_fallback` to be the current store from which you’re sharding off this workload. - Add `use_primary_and_secondary_stores_for_<store_name>` and `use_primary_store_as_default_for_<store_name>` feature flags, matching the name of the new store. - Update the relevant client code to use the new store. [Example issue and MRs.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2149) ## Infrastructure changes [Section titled “Infrastructure changes”](#infrastructure-changes) With the [current k8s overhead due to the networking stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/16871), we can only migrate workloads that are expected to remain well under saturation threshold to Kubernetes. [See discussion points here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2130). This means that in most cases, we’ll likely be functionally sharding off onto VMs, but I’ve included the k8s documentation for when we can shift to using that more. We presently do not have a well known method of creating a redis cluster shard, but that is work in progress as well. ### VMs [Section titled “VMs”](#vms) 1. [Create a chef role](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/blob/master/roles/gprd-base-db-redis-server-db-load-balancing.json) 2. [Provision in terraform](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5009) 3. [Configure with redis-reconfigure.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/redis-reconfigure.sh) Step 1 and 2 will leave the cluster in a strange state, with each redis host believing they are the primary and a somewhat confused sentinel quorum. In order to get things back in order, you’ll need to run chef-client, gitlab-ctl reconfigure, and set each secondary to be a replica of the primary. The redis-reconfigure.sh script does this for you. Terminal]  **Direct Answer:**\\n\\nMigration procedures for Redis sharding, including cluster setup and reconfiguration, are integral to maintaining high availability and performance, especially during failover events. Properly executed resharding and reconfiguration ensure that hash slot ownership is correctly distributed, reducing the risk of data loss or inconsistency. During failover, Redis cluster logs and master switch events indicate which node has become the new master, guiding reconfiguration steps. Handling redirections and fixing hanging keyslots after migration are crucial to restore cluster health. Monitoring key metrics like redirection rates, slot failures, and error ratios helps detect issues early, ensuring the cluster remains available and performant.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n### 1. Prepare for Migration and Monitor Cluster Health\\n- Continuously observe Redis Cluster dashboard metrics:\\n  - CPU/Memory saturation\\n  - Apdex violations\\n  - Slot failures (`redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview`)\\n  - Redirection rates (`redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview`)\\n- If impact is detected, stop migration by pressing `ctrl + c`.\\n\\n### 2. Calibrate Migration Batch Size\\n- Perform trial migrations with incremental `BATCH_SIZE` (e.g., start with 10, then 30, etc.).\\n- Use the command:\\n  ```bash\\n  ssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n  time sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n  ```\\n- Adjust `BATCH_SIZE` based on resource impact and migration speed.\\n\\n### 3. Execute Resharding (Migration)\\n- For each set of keyslots to move:\\n  ```bash\\n  ssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n  time sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n  ```\\n- Monitor resource metrics during migration.\\n- If needed, halt migration with `ctrl + c`. Be aware this may leave a hanging keyslot.\\n\\n### 4. Fix Hanging Keyslots\\n- If a migration is interrupted or cluster state is broken:\\n  ```bash\\n  ssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n  ```\\n- This command repairs the cluster state and resolves hanging keyslots.\\n\\n### 5. Handle Failover Events and Master Switch Logs\\n- During failover, Redis logs indicate new master election.\\n- Use monitoring dashboards to observe `cluster_redirection` errors:\\n  - MOVED and ASK redirections show client redirection to new masters.\\n- Update client configurations if necessary; redirections are normal during failover.\\n- After failover, ensure all nodes are synchronized and keyslot ownership is correct.\\n\\n### 6. Post-Migration and Reconfiguration\\n- Confirm cluster health:\\n  - No slot failures\\n  - Low redirection rates\\n  - No errors in error ratio dashboards\\n- Rotate pods/deployments to clear cached keyslot mappings, reducing redirection impact.\\n- Continue monitoring key metrics to ensure stability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Commands:**\\n- Check cluster state:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info 127.0.0.1:6379\\n  ```\\n- Fix cluster after interrupted migration:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n  ```\\n- Reshard keyslots:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <SLOTS> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Important Notes:**\\n- Always monitor resource utilization during migration to prevent saturation.\\n- Killing a migration process may leave keyslots in a hanging state; run `--cluster fix` to recover.\\n- Redirections during failover are expected; ensure clients handle MOVED/ASK responses.\\n- Regularly review cluster logs and metrics to detect and address issues proactively.\\n- Resharding is a planned, controlled operation; avoid frequent or unplanned resharding to maintain stability.\\n\\nThis structured approach ensures high availability and optimal performance during Redis sharding, cluster reconfiguration, and failover events.                                                                                                                                                                   Migration procedures for Redis sharding, such as setting up clusters and reconfiguring nodes, are essential for distributing workload and achieving horizontal scaling, which directly impacts high availability and performance. Proper cluster setup ensures that Redis instances can failover seamlessly during failover events, with master switch logs providing critical information about role changes and failover occurrences. By combining effective sharding migration techniques with vigilant monitoring of master switch logs, infrastructure engineers can maintain Redis high availability, quickly respond to failover events, and optimize performance within complex infrastructure setups.      0.263158          0.777949                1.0        0.666667            0.735546                    0.0\n",

By default, we have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster. Until now, we just added Redis instances for new shard to the cluster, but they do not have any Redis keys (keyslots) yet and hence they are not serving any user requests.\\nIn this phase, we will migrate some keyslots from previous Redis shards to the new shard, so that new Redis instances start load sharing with existing Redis instances and hence lower their resource (CPU/Memory) utilization.

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n# Redis Cluster\\n## Core concepts\\n[Section titled “Core concepts”](#core-concepts)\\nRedis Cluster is a mode of Redis to enable horizontal scaling.

Here's a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how to scale up a Redis Cluster and manage nodes from 1-hop and 2-hop information themes, based on the provided runbook documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 1. Direct Answer\\nTo scale up a Redis Cluster, you need to add new nodes (shards) and redistribute keyslots (resharding) so that the load is balanced across all nodes. Managing nodes involves understanding their 1-hop (direct neighbors) and 2-hop (neighbors of neighbors) relationships, which helps in troubleshooting, reconfiguration, and ensuring cluster health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n## A. Prepare for Scaling\\n1. **Check Current Cluster State**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```bash\\n     redis-cli --cluster info <any-node-ip>:<port>\\n     ```\\n   - Confirm `cluster_slots_fail`, `cluster_slots_pfail`, `cluster_known_nodes`, and `cluster_size`.\\n   - Ensure `cluster_slots_fail` and `cluster_slots_pfail` are 0 for a healthy cluster.\\n\\n2. **Identify Existing Nodes and Their Relationships**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```bash\\n     redis-cli --cluster nodes <any-node-ip>:<port>\\n     ```\\n   - This lists all nodes with their IDs, roles, and linkages (1-hop info).\\n\\n## B. Add New Nodes (Scaling Out)\\n3. **Provision New Redis Nodes**\\n   - Deploy new Redis instances with `cluster-enabled yes` and `enable-debug-command` configured.\\n   - Ensure they are reachable and properly configured.\\n\\n4. **Reconfigure Existing Nodes to Recognize New Nodes**\\n   - From a node, run:\\n     ```bash\\n     redis-cli --cluster add-node <new-node-ip>:<port> <existing-node-ip>:<port>\\n     ```\\n   - Repeat for all new nodes.\\n\\n## C. Resharding (Redis Key Redistribution)\\n5. **Check Current Keyslot Assignments**\\n   - On a master node:\\n     ```bash\\n     sudo redis-cli -c -h <node-ip> -p <port> cluster slots\\n     ```\\n   - Note the ranges of hash slots assigned to each master.\\n\\n6. **Reshard to Distribute Keyslots Equally**\\n   - Use the runbook's recommended script:\\n     ```bash\\n     scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n     ```\\n   - This script migrates keyslots from existing masters to new nodes, balancing load.\\n\\n7. **Monitor Resharding Progress**\\n   - Check cluster state:\\n     ```bash\\n     redis-cli --cluster info <any-node-ip>:<port>\\n     ```\\n   - Confirm `cluster_slots_fail` and `cluster_slots_pfail` remain 0.\\n\\n## D. Managing Nodes from 1-hop and 2-hop Info\\n8. **Identify Node Relationships**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```bash\\n     redis-cli --cluster nodes <any-node-ip>:<port>\\n     ```\\n   - This shows each node's neighbors (1-hop). To understand 2-hop, examine the neighbors' neighbors.\\n\\n9. **Troubleshoot or Reconfigure Using Relationship Data**\\n   - For node failures or rebalancing, consider the node's 1-hop and 2-hop relationships to determine the best nodes for failover or reconfiguration.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 3. Key Commands\\n- **Check cluster info:**\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster info <node-ip>:<port>\\n  ```\\n- **List nodes and relationships:**\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster nodes <node-ip>:<port>\\n  ```\\n- **Add a new node:**\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster add-node <new-node-ip>:<port> <existing-node-ip>:<port>\\n  ```\\n- **Reshard cluster:**\\n  ```bash\\n  scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n  ```\\n- **Check slot assignment:**\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <node-ip> -p <port> cluster slots\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:**\\n  - All nodes must have `enable-debug-command` enabled before reconfiguration.\\n  - Ensure cluster health (`cluster_slots_fail` and `cluster_slots_pfail` are 0) before resharding.\\n- **Cautions:**\\n  - Resharding is a live operation; monitor progress carefully.\\n  - Always backup current cluster state before major changes.\\n  - When adding nodes, ensure they are properly configured and reachable.\\n- **Additional Context:**\\n  - Managing from 1-hop and 2-hop info helps in understanding cluster topology, especially during troubleshooting or complex rebalancing.\\n  - Use the `redis-cli --cluster` commands to get real-time topology and health info.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis structured approach ensures safe scaling and effective management of your Redis Cluster nodes, leveraging both direct (1-hop) and extended (2-hop) relationship insights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      to scale up redis cluster and manage nodes, you need to create or recreate clusters from snapshots as described in the 1-hop context, and also perform scaling, upgrades, and maintenance activities outlined in the 2-hop context, such as geo patroni cluster management and managing redis cluster features, ensuring proper provisioning and management of redis nodes.      0.576923          0.725072                1.0        0.333333            0.619295                    0.0\n",

[primary fails (as determined by Sentinel), one of the replicas is promoted to primary.\\nClients are configured to connect to the sentinels which will then direct them to the current primary; there is no load\\nbalancer involved in this path. Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., ```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n1)  1) \"name\"\\n2) \"gstg-redis-cache\"        # cluster_id\\n3) \"ip\"\\n4) \"10.224.8.103\"            # ip address of the current master\\n5) \"port\"\\n6) \"6379\"\\n7) \"runid\"\\n8) \"06277f7abca059c268b2c5e2b2581d7d3bf330f1\"\\n9) \"flags\"\\n10) \"master\"\\n11) \"link-pending-commands\"\\n12) \"0\"\\n13) \"link-refcount\"\\n14) \"1\"\\n15) \"last-ping-sent\"\\n16) \"0\"\\n17) \"last-ok-ping-reply\"\\n18) \"440\"\\n19) \"last-ping-reply\"\\n20) \"440\"\\n21) \"down-after-milliseconds\"\\n22) \"10000\"\\n23) \"info-refresh\"\\n24) \"9021\"\\n25) \"role-reported\"\\n26) \"master\"\\n27) \"role-reported-time\"\\n28) \"956691745\"\\n29) \"config-epoch\"\\n30) \"51\"\\n31) \"num-slaves\"\\n32) \"2\"\\n33) \"num-other-sentinels\"\\n34) \"2\"\\n35) \"quorum\"\\n36) \"2\"\\n37) \"failover-timeout\"\\n38) \"60000\"\\n39) \"parallel-syncs\"\\n40) \"1\"\\n```\\n1.

[Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1) [see above](#grafana) ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1) Redis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` . It is scraped by Prometheus. See [the exporter documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) for more details. [Example `redis_exporter` metric](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=redis_commands_processed_total&g0.tab=1) in Thanos. ### redis-cli [Section titled “redis-cli”](#redis-cli) Run: - [INFO command](https://redis.io/commands/info) - [MEMORY\\_STATS command](https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats) NOTE: DO NOT USE [MONITOR] COMMAND! It streams back every command processed by the Redis server which can double the use of resources. It can overload a production machine making it unresponsive or causing an OOM kill. NOTE: DO NOT USE [KEYS] COMMAND! It will overload a production machine. ## What is causing Redis to slowdown? [Section titled “What is causing Redis to slowdown?”](#what-is-causing-redis-to-slowdown) The application relies on Redis throughput to be very high, latency spikes can be detrimental to the operation of the entire application. ### Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana”](#prometheusthanosgrafana) Explore Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana. Historical metrics might suggest a sudden change in the application behavior or traffic, for example: - operations rate, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=54> - keys rate of change, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=64> For Grafana links [see above](#grafana). ### slowlog [Section titled “slowlog”](#slowlog) The slowlog records slow Redis queries. Redis [SLOWLOG command documentation](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog). Get top 10 Redis slowlog entries: Terminal window ``` > slowlog get 10 1) 1) (integer) 5100 # A unique progressive identifier for every slow log entry. 2) (integer) 1561019091 # The unix timestamp at which the logged command was processed. 3) (integer) 21390 # The amount of time needed for its execution, in microseconds. 4) 1) \"del\" # The array composing the arguments of the command. 2) \"cache:gitlab:242234:8213877:Ci::CompareTestReportsService\" ``` To convert the timestamp, use `date -d @1561019091`. Get the command execution time threshold at which commands are logged (in microseconds): ``` > config get slowlog-log-slower-than ``` Get size of slowlog (entries are discarded like in a FIFO queue): ``` > config get slowlog-max-len ``` #### Monitoring number of slowlog entries [Section titled “Monitoring number of slowlog entries”](#monitoring-number-of-slowlog-entries) The number of entries added to the slowlog is exposed as a Prometheus metric and [there is a Grafana chart for it](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=48). #### Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog [Section titled “Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog”](#monitoring-the-rate-of-change-in-the-slowlog) A useful metric for monitoring potential slow-downs in Redis is measuring the rate of change in the `redis_slowlog_last_id`. This can be done by plotting (`changes(redis_slowlog_last_id[1h])`](../<https://prometheus.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1d&g0.expr=changes(redis_slowlog_last_id%5B1h%5D)&g0.tab=0>). ### Redis latency monitoring framework [Section titled “Redis latency monitoring framework”](#redis-latency-monitoring-framework) Redis provides a latency diagnostic tool: <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> You may need to enable it with `CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100`. From <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> : By default monitoring is disabled (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. However while the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well. #### LATENCY DOCTOR [Section titled “LATENCY DOCTOR”](#latency-doctor) Terminal window ``` > CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100 > LATENCY DOCTOR Dave, I have observed latency spikes in this Redis instance. You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave? 1. command: 5 latency spikes (average 300ms, mean deviation 120ms, period 73.40 sec). Worst all time event 500ms. I have a few advices for you: - Your current Slow Log configuration only logs events that are slower than your configured latency monitor threshold. Please use 'CONFIG, <2-hop>\\n\\npresented are an optimistic estimate, as redis will require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over. This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1> - Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example: Terminal window ``` $ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master 2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec') ``` #### Redis Sentinel [Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel)]                                                                                                                                                           ### 1. Direct Answer\\nFailover and recovery procedures are crucial in troubleshooting Redis slowdown causes and replication issues because they help identify whether the primary node's performance problems or network/replication failures are impacting Redis availability and responsiveness. By intentionally triggering failovers or recovering nodes, SREs can isolate whether issues are due to node saturation, network partitions, or replication flapping, and verify the cluster's resilience and proper functioning during recovery.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### A. Diagnosing Redis Slowdown Using Failover Procedures\\n1. **Check Current Redis Status**\\n   - Use `redis-cli` or Grafana dashboards to verify if Redis is slow or unresponsive.\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info\\n     ```\\n   - Look for high latency, slow logs, or memory issues.\\n\\n2. **Identify if the Primary is Saturated or Unresponsive**\\n   - Confirm if the primary node is overwhelmed (CPU, memory, or network saturation).\\n   - Check Sentinel logs for timeout or health check failures:\\n     ```\\n     sudo tail -f /var/log/gitlab/sentinel/current\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Trigger a Controlled Failover**\\n   - If the primary appears unresponsive or slow, initiate a manual failover to test recovery:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n     ```\\n   - Replace `<sentinel_port>` with the Sentinel port (e.g., 26379) and `<CLUSTER_NAME>` with your cluster name (e.g., `gprd-redis`).\\n\\n4. **Observe the Failover Process**\\n   - Monitor Sentinel logs and the new primary's responsiveness.\\n   - Check if the new primary handles requests efficiently.\\n   - Confirm that the old primary re-synchronizes as a replica after recovery.\\n\\n5. **Assess Impact on Replication and Client Connectivity**\\n   - Verify clients reconnect correctly via Sentinel.\\n   - Check replication lag on new replicas:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli info replication\\n     ```\\n   - Look for high `master_repl_offset` differences indicating lag.\\n\\n#### B. Troubleshooting Replication Flapping\\n1. **Check Replication Status**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli info replication\\n     ```\\n   - Look for `role`, `master_link_status`, and `master_sync_in_progress`.\\n\\n2. **Identify Causes of Flapping**\\n   - Review Sentinel logs for frequent failovers.\\n   - Check network connectivity:\\n     ```\\n     ping <redis_host>\\n     ```\\n   - Check for host resource issues (OOM, CPU saturation).\\n\\n3. **Perform Recovery**\\n   - If replication is flapping, consider restarting Redis or fixing network issues.\\n   - If needed, manually switch master:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n     ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Check Redis info:**\\n  ```\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info\\n  ```\\n- **Trigger Sentinel failover:**\\n  ```\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n  ```\\n- **Check replication status:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli info replication\\n  ```\\n- **Check Sentinel masters:**\\n  ```\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL masters\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have access to Sentinel ports and Redis CLI.\\n- **Caution:** Manual failovers can temporarily impact client connections; perform during maintenance windows if possible.\\n- **Monitoring:** Use Grafana dashboards and Sentinel logs to observe cluster health during and after failover.\\n- **Resource Checks:** Always verify host resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to prevent saturation-induced slowdowns.\\n- **Recovery:** After failover, monitor replication lag and client connectivity to confirm stability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nFailover and recovery procedures help isolate whether Redis slowdown is due to primary saturation, network issues, or replication flapping. By intentionally triggering failovers and observing the cluster's behavior, SREs can identify root causes, verify recovery mechanisms, and ensure Redis remains resilient and performant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Failover and recovery procedures are essential for addressing redis slowdown causes and replication issues by ensuring that Redis can quickly switch to a healthy master if the current one fails, and by restoring replication links. These procedures include building new Redis servers, starting replication with 'slaveof' commands, and using Sentinel to manage automatic failover. Properly executing these steps helps maintain high availability, reduces latency spikes, and resolves replication problems, thereby improving Redis performance and stability.      0.625000          0.952819                1.0        0.666667            0.321210                    0.2\n",

Former attempts are documented here: - [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256) - [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358) ## Setting up instances [Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances) First, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely: - `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd` - `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1` - `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag` - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`) - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag` - `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`. - `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) When configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application. E.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes. **Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand. ### 1. Generate Redis passwords [Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords) Generate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using: ``` for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done ``` Update both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master): ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV> ``` Update the JSON payload to include the new instance details: ``` { ..., \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"redis_conf\": { \"masteruser\": \"replica\", \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"user\": [ \"default off\", \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\", \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\", \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\" ] } } } ``` Do the same for ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV> ``` Modify the existing JSON ``` { \"redis_exporter\": { \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"env\": { \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\" } } } } ``` ### 2. Create Chef roles [Section titled “2. Create Chef roles”](#2-create-chef-roles) Set the new chef roles and add the new role to the list of gitlab-redis roles in -infra-prometheus-server role. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3494). ### 3. Provision VMs [Section titled “3. Provision VMs”](#3-provision-vms) Provision the VMs via the generic-stor/google terraform module. This is done in the [config-mgmt project in the ops environment](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/). An example MR can be found [here](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5811). After the MR is merged and applied, check the VM state via: ``` gcloud compute instances list --project <GCP_PROJECT> | grep 'redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>' ``` You need to wait for the initial chef-client run to complete. One way to check is to tail the serial port output to check when the initial run is completed. An example: ``` gcloud compute --project=<GCP_PROJECT> instances tail-serial-port-output redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV> --zone us-east1-{c/b/d} ``` ### 4. Initialising the cluster [Section titled “4. Initialising the cluster”](#4-initialising-the-cluster) a. SSH into one of the instance: ``` ssh redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV>.c.<GCP_PROJECT>.internal ``` b. Run the following: ``` export ENV=<ENV> export PROJECT=<GCP_PROJECT> export DEPLOYMENT=redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE> ``` c. Use the following command to connect the master-nodes and initialise a working cluster. Add more shard FQDN where necessary. e.g. `$DEPLOYMENT-shard-<shard_number>-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379`. ``` sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster create \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-02-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-03-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 ``` Use the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..m}` where `n` is the number of shards and `m` is the number of instances per shard. ``` for i in {01,02,03}-{02,03}; do sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 sleep 2 done ``` Use the following command, to assign the replicas within each shard. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..n}` where necessary depending on the cluster-size. ``` for i in {01,02,03}; do for j in {02,03}; do node_id=\"$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster nodes | grep $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal | awk '{ print $1 }')\"; sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-$j-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal \\ cluster replicate $node_id done done ``` ### 5. Validation [Section titled “5. Validation”](#5-validation) Wait for a few seconds as the nodes need time to gossip. Check the status via: ``` $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal:6379 (9b0828e3...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.3:6379 (ac03fcee...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.4:6379 (f8341afd...) -> 0 keys | 5462 slots | 2 slaves. [OK] 0 keys in 3 masters. 0.00 keys per slot on average. $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster info | head -n7 cluster_state:ok cluster_slots_assigned:16384 cluster_slots_ok:16384 cluster_slots_pfail:0 cluster_slots_fail:0 cluster_known_nodes:9 cluster_size:3 ``` ## Configuring the applications [Section titled “Configuring the applications”](#configuring-the-applications) ### 1.

Direct Answer\\nHashicorp Vault is used for securely managing Redis cluster passwords by storing, rotating, and controlling access to secrets, ensuring that passwords are not hardcoded or stored insecurely. It provides a centralized, auditable, and automated way to handle sensitive credentials.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n**Step 1: Access Vault**\\n- Log into Vault with appropriate permissions.\\n- Use the Vault CLI or API to interact with secrets.\\n\\n**Step 2: Store Redis Password in Vault**\\n- Create a secret path for Redis credentials if not already existing.\\n- Example command:\\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv put secret/redis/cluster_password password=<your-redis-password>\\n  ```\\n- This stores the password securely in Vault.\\n\\n**Step 3: Retrieve Redis Password When Needed**\\n- Fetch the password dynamically during deployment or runtime:\\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv get -field=password secret/redis/cluster_password\\n  ```\\n- Use this retrieved password to configure Redis clients or clusters.\\n\\n**Step 4: Automate Rotation (Optional)**\\n- Set up Vault's dynamic secrets or periodic rotation policies to automatically change passwords.\\n- Use Vault's secret engine or scripting to rotate passwords regularly.\\n\\n**Step 5: Manage Access Control**\\n- Use Vault policies to restrict who can read or write Redis secrets.\\n- Assign appropriate roles and permissions via Vault's access management documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Store secret:**\\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv put secret/redis/cluster_password password=<password>\\n  ```\\n- **Retrieve secret:**\\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv get -field=password secret/redis/cluster_password\\n  ```\\n- **Configure policies (example):**\\n  ```bash\\n  vault policy write redis-access -<<EOF\\n  path \"secret/redis/*\" {\\n    capabilities = [\"read\"]\\n  }\\n  EOF\\n  ```\\n- **Assign policy to a token or role as per your setup.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure Vault is properly configured and accessible from your environment.\\n- **Security:** Never hardcode passwords; always fetch from Vault at runtime.\\n- **Access Control:** Use Vault policies to restrict who can access Redis secrets.\\n- **Rotation:** Implement password rotation policies to enhance security.\\n- **Auditing:** Vault logs all access; review regularly for security compliance.\\n- **Integration:** Update your Redis deployment scripts or configuration management to retrieve secrets from Vault dynamically.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:** Hashicorp Vault acts as a secure, centralized secrets management system for Redis passwords, enabling safer handling, rotation, and access control of sensitive credentials.

Data storage for sessions is in the order of 10GB (at end of 2021).\\n## Availability\\n[Section titled “Availability”](#availability)\\nThe usual redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\n## Durability\\n[Section titled “Durability”](#durability)\\nSession data is an interesting hybrid; we do *generally* want durability/persistence, but can tolerate some loss of data (generally a log-out for affected users). As such while we persist to disk with RDB, we also have maxmemory and an eviction policy (volatile-ttl) that will, if necessary, evict data with the shortest TTL remaining (sessions that were close to expiry anyway). Alerting is set to tell us if we are approaching that state of affairs, but that policy gives us space to mitigate/manage the situation without disaster.\\n## Monitoring/Alerting\\n[Section titled “Monitoring/Alerting”](#monitoringalerting)\\nGenerally the same as other Redis clusters, but with special handling for monitoring maximum memory (as a proportion of the configured limit, not the system limit), and alerting if redis\\_evicted\\_keys\\_total raises above zero (meaning we missed memory saturation)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis-sessions/README.md)\\n[Previous\\nRedis Registry Cache Service](/redis-registry-cache/)   [Next\\nRedis Sidekiq Service](/redis-sidekiq/), - [Replication issues](#replication-issues)\\n- [Switch Master manually](#switch-master-manually)\\n- [Replication flapping](#replication-flapping)\\n- [Redis is down](#redis-is-down)\\n- [Failed to collect Redis metrics](#failed-to-collect-redis-metrics)\\n- [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)\\n- [BigKeys analysis](#bigkeys-analysis)\\n- [References](#references)\\n# Troubleshooting\\n## Is redis running?\\n[Section titled “Is redis running?”](#is-redis-running)\\n### Grafana\\n[Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana)\\nGrafana dashboards:\\n- [redis](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-main/redis-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-cache](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-sidekiq](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-tracechunks](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-tracechunks-main/redis-tracechunks-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-ratelimiting](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-ratelimiting-main/redis-ratelimiting-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-sessions](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sessions-main/redis-sessions-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\nFor example, there is a Grafana chart showing number of slowlog events in redis-sidekiq (not linking it here because the panel ID changes when Grafana dashboards are deployed).\\n### Prometheus/Thanos\\n[Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos)\\n<https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1w&g0.expr=redis_up%20%3C%201&g0.tab=0>\\n### directly on a redis host\\n[Section titled “directly on a redis host”](#directly-on-a-redis-host)\\n- is redis up?\\n- `gitlab-ctl status`\\n- can we dial redis?\\n- `telnet localhost 6379`\\n- can we talk to redis via `redis-cli`?\\n```\\nREDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info\\n```\\n## How to get redis stats?\\n[Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats)\\n### Grafana\\n[Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1)\\n[see above](#grafana)\\n### Prometheus/Thanos\\n[Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1)\\nRedis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` .

NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial>\\nFrom time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes.\\nSo, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take:\\n1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`\\n- This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel\\n2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel`\\n- Not sure why, but it’s minor\\n3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master:\\n1.

So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status.\\nIt’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time.\\n### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)\\n[Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses

Verification of config in a VM [Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm) Check the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference. ``` [ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME> => \"PONG\" [ gstg ] production> ``` ### 3.

Direct Answer:**  \\nBased on the provided runbook documentation, GitLab does not directly manage Redis configurations through GitLab itself. Instead, Redis is managed via Chef cookbooks (`gitlab-redis`, `gitlab-redis-cluster`, and `omnibus-gitlab`) that handle deployment, configuration, and updates. The configuration files, such as `redis.conf`, are generated and managed by these cookbooks, and the process involves reconfiguring and restarting Redis services using `gitlab-ctl` commands. There is no indication that GitLab uses GitLab repositories or GitLab CI pipelines to manage Redis configurations directly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n**A. Understanding Redis Management in GitLab Infrastructure**  \\n- Redis is deployed and managed through Chef cookbooks:  \\n  - [gitlab-redis](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab-redis)  \\n  - [gitlab-redis-cluster](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab-redis-cluster)  \\n  - [omnibus-gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/cookbook-omnibus-gitlab)  \\n- Configuration files like `redis.conf` are generated during `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.\\n\\n**B. How Redis Configurations Are Managed**  \\n- When changes are needed, the standard procedure is to run:  \\n  1. `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` — to apply configuration changes and restart Redis with the new settings.  \\n  2. For Redis Sentinel setup, start Sentinel with:  \\n     `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel`  \\n- These commands reconfigure Redis based on the current Chef cookbook templates and settings stored in GitLab's configuration files.\\n\\n**C. Updating or Managing Redis Configurations**  \\n- To modify Redis configurations, update the relevant Chef cookbook attributes or configuration templates.  \\n- After making changes, run:  \\n  `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`  \\n- This process regenerates `redis.conf` and restarts Redis accordingly.\\n\\n**D. Additional Notes**  \\n- Direct manual edits to `redis.conf` are discouraged unless done through the Chef cookbooks or configuration management process.  \\n- For Redis cluster or sentinel setup, follow the procedures outlined in the runbook, ensuring `gitlab-ctl` commands are used to manage the services.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands:**\\n\\n| Action | Command | Description |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Reconfigure all GitLab services, including Redis | `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` | Applies configuration changes and restarts Redis |\\n| Start Redis Sentinel | `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` | Initiates Sentinel for Redis high availability |\\n| Check Redis service status | `gitlab-ctl status` | Verify Redis and related services are running |\\n| Access Redis CLI | `/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli` | Interact with Redis directly (requires auth if configured) |\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n- Redis configurations are managed via Chef cookbooks, not directly through GitLab repositories or GitLab CI pipelines.\\n- Always use `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` after making configuration changes to ensure consistency.\\n- Manual edits to Redis config files should be avoided unless explicitly supported by the configuration management process.\\n- For high availability or cluster setup, follow the procedures for Sentinel and replication as documented, ensuring proper coordination with the Chef-managed setup.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nGitLab's infrastructure manages Redis configurations primarily through Chef cookbooks and `gitlab-ctl` commands, not via GitLab repositories or GitLab itself. Configuration changes are made by updating the cookbooks or templates and reapplying with `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The context mentions GitLab in relation to verifying configuration in a VM, updating secrets, and configuring GitLab Rails, indicating that GitLab is used for managing redis configurations within the infrastructure setup.      1.000000          0.916801                1.0        1.000000            0.278367               0.250000\n",

Per-session storage is typically fairly small (hundreds of bytes), but there are a lot of them, they are touched a lot by active users, and some can be big either naturally or unexpectedly.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nRedis is deployed in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis.\\n## Scalability\\n[Section titled “Scalability”](#scalability)\\nSingle threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis, but at initial move we are anticipating something in the order of 20% absolute CPU usage. Data storage for sessions is in the order of 10GB (at end of 2021).\\n## Availability\\n[Section titled “Availability”](#availability)\\nThe usual redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\n## Durability\\n[Section titled “Durability”](#durability)\\nSession data is an interesting hybrid; we do *generally* want durability/persistence, but can tolerate some loss of data (generally a log-out for affected users). As such while we persist to disk with RDB, we also have maxmemory and an eviction policy (volatile-ttl) that will, if necessary, evict data with the shortest TTL remaining (sessions that were close to expiry anyway). Alerting is set to tell us if we are approaching that state of affairs, but that policy gives us space to mitigate/manage the situation without disaster.\\n## Monitoring/Alerting\\n[Section titled “Monitoring/Alerting”](#monitoringalerting)\\nGenerally the same as other Redis clusters, but with special handling for monitoring maximum memory (as a proportion of the configured limit, not the system limit), and alerting if redis\\_evicted\\_keys\\_total raises above zero (meaning we missed memory saturation)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis-sessions/README.md)\\n[Previous\\nRedis Registry Cache Service](/redis-registry-cache/)   [Next\\nRedis Sidekiq Service](/redis-sidekiq/), - [Network partition](#network-partition)\\n- [Persistence Guarantees](#persistence-guarantees)\\n- [What do we store?](#what-do-we-store)\\n- [Clients](#clients)\\n- [What about redis cluster?](#what-about-redis-cluster)\\n- [Maintanence](#maintanence)\\n- [Reconfigure](#reconfigure)\\n- [Debugging and Diagnosis](#debugging-and-diagnosis)\\n- [Identifying the primary](#identifying-the-primary)\\n- [Basic stats](#basic-stats)\\n- [Slowlogs](#slowlogs)\\n- [ElasticSearch analysis](#elasticsearch-analysis)\\n- [Monitor commands](#monitor-commands)\\n- [Flamegraphs](#flamegraphs)\\n- [Bigkeys](#bigkeys)\\n# A survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab\\nSee also <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/redis.html> which covers some of the same\\nground, but with a developer orientation and the SRE-oriented [runbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md)\\n## What is Redis\\n[Section titled “What is Redis”](#what-is-redis)\\nRedis is a fast in-memory key-value store. It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability).

Sometimes we have incidents like\\n[#5478](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/5478) where we end up with invalid data in the cache, and no convenient way to\\nclear it. This document describes an approach for deleting a specified set of\\ncache keys on GitLab.com without consuming excessive Redis resources.\\nThis approach is split into two phases:\\n1. Obtain the keys to be deleted (against a secondary)\\n2. Delete the specified keys (against the primary)\\nBy doing this, we gain a few benefits:\\n1. We perform as few operations on the primary as necessary. Secondaries do not\\nreceive application traffic, and so have more headroom and can tolerate being\\nblocked briefly.\\n2. We can retain a list of deleted keys for later inspection - for instance, if\\na user reports an issue, we can check if their cache key was in the list.\\n3. Obtaining the keys to be deleted may be an iterative, exploratory process. We\\ndo not want to conflate this with data deletion, which should ideally be as\\nsimple as possible.\\n(In the future we may move to having [version-based cache invalidation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9815), where\\nthis will be simpler.

            # 1. Direct Answer\\nAn SSL Certificate is a digital credential used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between a client (such as a web browser or application) and a server (like Redis or other services). It verifies the identity of the server, ensuring that data transmitted is confidential and protected from eavesdropping or tampering.\\n\\n# 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\nWhile the runbook documentation does not explicitly detail SSL certificates, understanding their role in securing Redis connections is essential. Here’s a general procedure to verify or configure SSL certificates for Redis, based on best practices:\\n\\n### Step 1: Identify if Redis is configured to use SSL\\n- Check Redis configuration files (e.g., `/etc/redis/redis.conf` or `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf`) for SSL-related settings:\\n  - `tls-port` (indicates SSL is enabled)\\n  - `tls-cert-file` (path to the SSL certificate)\\n  - `tls-key-file` (path to the private key)\\n  - `tls-ca-cert-file` (path to CA certificate)\\n\\n### Step 2: Verify the SSL certificate\\n- Ensure the certificate file specified exists and is valid.\\n- Use OpenSSL to inspect the certificate:\\n  ```bash\\n  openssl x509 -in /path/to/ssl/cert.pem -text -noout\\n  ```\\n- Check for:\\n  - Validity dates\\n  - Correct hostname (matches Redis server hostname)\\n  - Proper issuer\\n\\n### Step 3: Confirm Redis is accepting SSL connections\\n- Use `redis-cli` with TLS support:\\n  ```bash\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli --tls --cert /path/to/ssl/cert.pem --key /path/to/ssl/key.pem --cacert /path/to/ssl/ca.pem -h redis-hostname -p tls-port info\\n  ```\\n- Or, if using a client that supports SSL, connect and verify the connection is encrypted.\\n\\n### Step 4: Update or replace SSL certificates if needed\\n- Generate new certificates if expired or invalid, following your organization’s certificate issuance process.\\n- Replace the existing certificate files.\\n- Restart Redis to apply changes:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n  ```\\n\\n### Step 5: Monitor SSL certificate expiration\\n- Set reminders to renew certificates before expiration.\\n- Use tools like `openssl` or certificate management solutions to monitor expiry dates.\\n\\n# 3. Key Commands\\n- Check Redis SSL configuration:\\n  ```bash\\n  grep -i 'tls-' /etc/redis/redis.conf\\n  ```\\n- Inspect SSL certificate:\\n  ```bash\\n  openssl x509 -in /path/to/ssl/cert.pem -text -noout\\n  ```\\n- Test Redis connection with TLS:\\n  ```bash\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli --tls --cert /path/to/ssl/cert.pem --key /path/to/ssl/key.pem --cacert /path/to/ssl/ca.pem -h redis-hostname -p tls-port info\\n  ```\\n- Restart Redis after certificate update:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n  ```\\n\\n# 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have access to Redis configuration files and the SSL certificate files.\\n- **Security:** Keep private keys secure; do not expose them.\\n- **Compatibility:** Clients connecting to Redis must support TLS/SSL.\\n- **Renewal:** Certificates typically expire; set up monitoring or automation to renew before expiration.\\n- **No explicit SSL procedures** are detailed in the runbook, but securing Redis with SSL is critical for encrypted communication, especially in production environments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nAn SSL Certificate secures Redis connections by enabling encrypted communication and verifying server identity. Verify its presence and validity in Redis configuration, test connections with TLS, and replace certificates before they expire to maintain secure operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           SSL Certificate Expiring or Expired is mentioned in the context, indicating it is a certificate that may be nearing or past its expiration date, which is relevant for maintaining secure connections.      0.020408          0.593116                0.0        0.000000            0.103260               0.000000\n",

Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate.

When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Why partition?](#why-partition)\\n- [Timing](#timing)\\n- [Determining what to split off](#determining-what-to-split-off)\\n- [Implementation](#implementation)\\n- [Application changes](#application-changes)\\n- [Infrastructure changes](#infrastructure-changes)\\n- [VMs](#vms)\\n- [K8s](#k8s)\\n- [Redis-cluster](#redis-cluster)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Migration process](#migration-process)\\n- [Verification](#verification)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Why partition?](#why-partition)\\n- [Timing](#timing)\\n- [Determining what to split off](#determining-what-to-split-off)\\n- [Implementation](#implementation)\\n- [Application changes](#application-changes)\\n- [Infrastructure changes](#infrastructure-changes)\\n- [VMs](#vms)\\n- [K8s](#k8s)\\n- [Redis-cluster](#redis-cluster)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Migration process](#migration-process)\\n- [Verification](#verification)\\n# Functional Partitioning\\n## Why partition?\\n[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition)\\nRedis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done.\\nIn the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well.\\nThe other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system.\\n## Timing\\n[Section titled “Timing”](#timing), replication resynchronization). If all 3 nodes fail at once, the entire cache will be wiped; this is not ideal but\\nacceptable as it will be refilled on demand. For ratelimiting, the data has only short term usefulness anyway (generally\\n1 minute, with some up to 3 minutes) so complete loss is not significant.\\n## What do we store?\\n[Section titled “What do we store?”](#what-do-we-store)\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/419> contains some summary analysis of the keyspace across\\nthe persistent and cache instances, as at July 2020. This will change over time as the code base evolves, but the link\\nprovides some indication what we’re storing (it’s not as wide a range of things as you might expect in the\\npersistent instance).\\nThe data stored in the sidekiq instances is not really under our control (it’s whatever sidekiq needs to do its job).\\nSome details on that are available in [Sidekiq Survival Guide for SREs](../../sidekiq/sidekiq-survival-guide-for-sres).\\nThe data in the tracechunks instance is exclusively the output of CI jobs on its way into Object Storage (received by\\nand API request, written into Redis, and a Sidekiq job immediately scheduled to asynchronously write it to Object Storage);\\nwhile important, it is also extremely transient, and under normal circumstances there should be no significant build up\\nof data in this instance. Any such build up implies a problem (Sidekiq not processing, perhaps?) and so we have\\nparticularly low alert thresholds for memory saturation on this instance. At the time we chose to split this instance\\nfrom the primary persistent (shared state) instance (mid 2021), CI trace chunks were responsible for roughly 60% of the\\ndata throughput into/out of the shared state redis, and 16% of Redis calls.\\nThe data in the ratelimiting instance is a set of keys identifying actors (typically users, IP addresses, or in some\\ncases projects) and activities, with the value being the count of usage in the current period (the period is also encoded\\ninto the key name). TTLs are used to expire these automatically so there’s no manual cleanup by clients, it is automatic\\nand internal to Redis.\\nThe data in the sessions instance is exclusively that related to web sessions.\\n## Clients\\n[Section titled “Clients”](#clients)\\nMost of the clients are Ruby, specifically Rails code on the web, api, git, and sidekiq nodes. Workhorse (in Go) also\\n[uses](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/blob/master/README.md#redis) Redis to do long polling for CI build requests.\\nRails uses the generic [connection\\_pool](https://github.com/mperham/connection_pool) to maintain long running connections\\nwhich are used by threads/workers as necessary, which is particularly important as redis is typically expected to be\\nvery fast and low latency.\\nSee [High Availability](#high-availability) for some comments regarding connections via sentinels.\\n## What about redis cluster?\\n[Section titled “What about redis cluster?”](#what-about-redis-cluster)\\n[Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec) is a Redis feature that lets you horizontally shard data across\\nmultiple machines. If any one of our Redis clusters grows too large to fit in memory on a single machine or such that\\nthe single-threaded CPU becomes a hard limit, then Redis Cluster is a possible mitigation. Manually sharding the data\\nis an alternative approach, e.g. having more than one cache cluster and dividing the types of keys up in some way using\\napplication controlled logic, or splitting the sidekiq processing onto multiple clusters. Neither option is low effort.\\nSee the [Redis Cluster documentation for more details](../../redis/redis-cluster).\\nSee:\\n1. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9788>\\n2. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/305>\\n## Maintanence\\n[Section titled “Maintanence”](#maintanence)\\n### Reconfigure\\n[Section titled “Reconfigure”](#reconfigure)\\nIn order to apply config changes, we need to run a `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.

This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up.\\nReplication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream.\\n<https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1>\\n##### Redis Replication Events\\n[Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events)\\n- Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over.

Clients will query Sentinel and then connect directly to the primary Redis (in other words, Sentinel does not proxy requests).\\nAdditionally, Sentinel will reconfigure Redis instances as primary or secondaries, depending on the Sentinel clusters quorum.\\nFor more information see [Sentinel documentation](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel)\\nSentinel is configured via `gitlab.rb`:\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n$ sudo grep redis_sentinels /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb\\ngitlab_rails['redis_sentinels'] = [{\"host\"=>\"10.66.2.101\", \"port\"=>26379}, {\"host\"=>\"10.66.2.102\", \"port\"=>26379}, {\"host\"=>\"10.66.2.103\", \"port\"=>26379}]\\n```\\nwhich gets translated into `/var/opt/gitlab/sentinel/sentinel.conf`.\\n##### Get Redis master\\n[Section titled “Get Redis master”](#get-redis-master)\\nOnce you have the IP of a sentinel, use `redis-cli` to access sentinel. Sentinel usually runs on port `26379` (ie, Redis port (`6379`) + `20000`). The `sentinel masters` command will return a list of Redis primaries managed by this sentinel cluster:\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -h 10.66.2.101 -p 26379 sentinel masters\\n6379 sentinel masters\\n1)  1) \"name\"\\n2) \"gitlab-redis\"\\n3) \"ip\", Ensure the selector mark (`*`) is beside `gke_gitlab-production_us-east1_gprd-gitlab-gke` (the regional cluster), not one of the 3 zonal clusters.\\nIf it is not, then you must command it to be selected using: `kubectl config use-context gke_gitlab-production_us-east1_gprd-gitlab-gke`\\nNext, invoke: `kubectl -n gitlab edit hpa/gitlab-sidekiq-catchall-v1`\\nFind the `maxReplicas` line, and reduce it.\\nDefault, or git version, is `175`, and we have had good success at `100` with reducing load but not having too much of a backlog. The `70` target was too low at one point, but `80` was ok at quiet times. YMMV, season to taste.\\nMost important is ensuring `maxReplicas` is adjusted back to the same version as in git once we’re done, so that automated processes don’t tromp over it or get confused. Ensure you engage with Delivery (Graeme in particular) so that they know that auto deploys may be interrupted/broken, and perhaps to review the status of helm once configuration is restored to normal.\\n### Tags\\n[Section titled “Tags”](#tags)\\nTo enhance findability, here are some keywords.\\nredis, redis-sidekiq, catchall, workloads, k8s, kubernetes, VMs, virtual machines, gke,\\n[Edit

immediately when received by the API from runners, before they are asynchronously (Ci::BuildTraceChunkFlushWorker) moved from there to ObjectStorage (as configured in .com; the database is another target option, but we don’t do that anymore). The data is important and persistent but transient (seconds to 10s of seconds normally, probably not minutes, definitely not hours, unless something has gone horribly wrong). This was split because as found in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327469#note_556531587> these trace chunks were (at the time) responsible for about 60% of the network throughput by bytes on the persistent redis, and 16% of the Redis calls, and it is a distinctive enough workload/usage pattern that splitting it out was deemed a good thing. Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters) Single threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then) The usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> ) Data is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable. Uses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover from. -]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ### 1. Direct Answer\\n**gitlab.com** is the domain for GitLab's hosted platform, which provides source code management, CI/CD, and DevOps tools. In the context of Redis runbooks, it refers to the infrastructure and operational environment managed by GitLab for their services, including Redis clusters used for caching, sessions, rate limiting, and other workloads.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\nSince your question is about \"what is gitlab.com\" in the context of Redis and runbook documentation, here’s a structured explanation:\\n\\n**a. Understand the Context:**\\n- GitLab.com is the hosted platform where GitLab's services run.\\n- The runbook documentation details how Redis clusters are managed within GitLab's infrastructure, including Sentinel-based high availability, failover procedures, and cluster configurations.\\n\\n**b. Recognize the Infrastructure Setup:**\\n- Redis clusters at GitLab are monitored and managed via Sentinel, not Redis Cluster.\\n- Sentinel manages primary failover, client redirection, and configuration.\\n- Different clusters (persistent, sidekiq, cache) have slightly different setups, some with Sentinel on VMs, others with dedicated Sentinel VMs.\\n\\n**c. Operational Procedures:**\\n- Failover, node failure handling, and recovery procedures are documented.\\n- Commands and checks (e.g., Sentinel commands, Prometheus metrics) are used to monitor and manage Redis at gitlab.com.\\n\\n**d. Use the Runbook for Management:**\\n- For Redis health checks, use `redis-cli` with Sentinel commands.\\n- For failover or reconfiguration, run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.\\n- For monitoring, use Prometheus dashboards and logs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands and Configurations\\n- **Check Sentinel configuration:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo grep redis_sentinels /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb\\n  ```\\n- **Get Redis master via Sentinel:**\\n  ```bash\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -h <sentinel_host> -p 26379 sentinel masters\\n  ```\\n- **Reconfigure GitLab to apply Redis config changes:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure\\n  ```\\n- **Monitor Redis via Prometheus:**\\n  - List primaries:\\n    [redis_master_repl_offset > 0](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1)\\n  - Check replication lag:\\n    [Redis Replication Lag Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **No Load Balancer:** Clients connect to Sentinel, which directs them to the current primary; Redis does not proxy requests.\\n- **Failover Handling:** Sentinel manages primary promotion automatically; no manual intervention needed under normal conditions.\\n- **Cluster Differences:** Some clusters run Sentinel on VMs alongside Redis; others have dedicated Sentinel VMs.\\n- **Slowness & Failover:** Redis saturation can cause Sentinel to misinterpret node health, triggering unnecessary failovers.\\n- **Operational Caution:** Always run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` with proper coordination; avoid abrupt changes.\\n- **Monitoring:** Use Prometheus and logs for health checks and troubleshooting.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\n**gitlab.com** in this context refers to GitLab's hosted environment where Redis clusters are deployed and managed with Sentinel for high availability. The runbook provides detailed procedures for monitoring, failover, reconfiguration, and troubleshooting within this environment.

It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability).

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n# Redis Cluster\\n## Core concepts\\n[Section titled “Core concepts”](#core-concepts)\\nRedis Cluster is a mode of Redis to enable horizontal scaling.

As such while we persist to disk with RDB, we also have maxmemory and an eviction policy (volatile-ttl) that will, if necessary, evict data with the shortest TTL remaining (sessions that were close to expiry anyway). Alerting is set to tell us if we are approaching that state of affairs, but that policy gives us space to mitigate/manage the situation without disaster.\\n## Monitoring/Alerting\\n[Section titled “Monitoring/Alerting”](#monitoringalerting)\\nGenerally the same as other Redis clusters, but with special handling for monitoring maximum memory (as a proportion of the configured limit, not the system limit), and alerting if redis\\_evicted\\_keys\\_total raises above zero (meaning we missed memory saturation)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis-sessions/README.md)\\n[Previous\\nRedis Registry Cache Service](/redis-registry-cache/)   [Next\\nRedis Sidekiq Service](/redis-sidekiq/)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           [<1-hop>\\n\\n[Connecting To a Database via Teleport](/teleport/Connect_to_Database_Console_via_Teleport/) -

system The Chat Cache Redis Cluster instances is a distinct Redis Cluster used by the GitLab Rails [chat features](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410521). Redis is in a 3-node-per-shard (single-primary/two-replica per shard) VM configuration, in cluster mode. The node count will start off at 3 but will increase as we scale horizontally. Uses the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters.

Direct Answer\\nConnecting to various services via Teleport simplifies management of PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters by providing secure, unified, and auditable access to multiple services through a single SSH gateway. This approach enhances operational efficiency, improves security posture, and streamlines multi-service access, especially in complex Redis, PostgreSQL, and Patroni environments, by enabling SREs to securely connect to different clusters without exposing direct network endpoints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n**Step 1: Ensure Teleport Access is Configured**\\n- Verify that your user account has the necessary Teleport roles and permissions to access the target services (PostgreSQL, Patroni, Redis).\\n- Confirm that your local environment has the Teleport CLI (`tsh`) installed and configured.\\n\\n**Step 2: Connect to Teleport Gateway**\\n- Use `tsh` to authenticate and establish a session:\\n  ```bash\\n  tsh login --proxy=<teleport-proxy-host> --user=<your-username>\\n  ```\\n- This authenticates your session and caches credentials for subsequent commands.\\n\\n**Step 3: Access PostgreSQL via Teleport**\\n- Use `tsh` to connect to the PostgreSQL service:\\n  ```bash\\n  tsh db connect <postgresql-service-name> --db-user=<user> --db-name=<dbname>\\n  ```\\n- Alternatively, for direct psql access:\\n  ```bash\\n  psql \"host=localhost port=5432 user=<user> dbname=<dbname> sslmode=disable\"\\n  ```\\n  (Teleport forwards the connection securely to the PostgreSQL cluster.)\\n\\n**Step 4: Access Patroni-managed PostgreSQL**\\n- Patroni clusters are typically managed via PostgreSQL instances; connect similarly through Teleport:\\n  ```bash\\n  tsh db connect <patroni-service-name> --db-user=<user> --db-name=<dbname>\\n  ```\\n- Use `psql` as above, ensuring the connection is routed through Teleport.\\n\\n**Step 5: Access Redis Clusters via Teleport**\\n- Teleport can proxy Redis connections:\\n  ```bash\\n  tsh proxy redis --redis-host=<redis-host> --redis-port=<port>\\n  ```\\n- Or, connect directly with Redis CLI:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -h localhost -p <port>\\n  ```\\n  (Teleport forwards the Redis connection securely.)\\n\\n**Step 6: Manage Multi-Service Access**\\n- Use Teleport's multiplexed sessions to switch between services seamlessly.\\n- For scripting or automation, use `tsh` commands with appropriate service names and parameters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n\\n| Action | Command Example |\\n|---|---|\\n| Login to Teleport | `tsh login --proxy=<proxy-host> --user=<user>` |\\n| Connect to PostgreSQL | `tsh db connect <service-name> --db-user=<user> --db-name=<dbname>` |\\n| Connect to Redis | `tsh proxy redis --redis-host=<host> --redis-port=<port>` |\\n| Use `psql` via Teleport | `psql \"host=localhost port=5432 user=<user> dbname=<dbname> sslmode=disable\"` |\\n| Use `redis-cli` via Teleport | `redis-cli -h localhost -p <port>` |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure your user has the correct Teleport roles and permissions for all relevant services.\\n- **Security:** Teleport provides encrypted tunnels, reducing exposure of direct service endpoints.\\n- **Auditing:** Teleport logs all access, aiding compliance and troubleshooting.\\n- **Service Names:** Use the correct service identifiers as configured in Teleport (e.g., `postgresql-main`, `redis-cluster-XX`).\\n- **Connection Management:** For persistent sessions, consider using `tsh` SSH multiplexing features.\\n- **Limitations:** Some operations may require specific Teleport configurations or elevated permissions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nConnecting via Teleport centralizes and secures multi-service access, enabling SREs to efficiently manage PostgreSQL, Patroni, and Redis clusters without exposing direct network endpoints, thus streamlining operational workflows and enhancing security.  Connecting to various services via Teleport enables secure and streamlined access to multiple infrastructure components, including PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters, by providing centralized authentication and access management. This facilitates troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintenance of these clusters within complex setups. In the context of Redis infrastructure, Teleport's ability to connect to diverse services ensures that engineers can efficiently manage Redis databases alongside PostgreSQL and Patroni, supporting high availability and performance. By enabling multi-service access through a unified platform, Teleport simplifies multi-hop workflows, allowing engineers to perform multi-layered operations—such as connecting to Redis clusters, then accessing PostgreSQL or Patroni clusters—without compromising security or efficiency.      0.849315          0.911474                0.0        1.000000            0.729125               0.200000\n",

The dataset is divided among multiple nodes, allowing the computational load to be distributed.\\nHow does Redis Cluster differ from non-clustered Sentinel-based Redis instances?\\nPropertySentinelClusterDatasetEvery node has the entire datasetDistributed over `n` nodesComputationPerformed by master nodePerformed by respective hash slot ownerOperationsAll standard operations allowedCross-slot operations are not permittedScalabilityOnly vertical scalingIncrease cluster’s shard sizeFailoversCoordinated by SentinelsCoordinated by a quorum of master nodes\\nReferences\\n- [Redis Cluster Specifications](https://redis.io/docs/reference/cluster-spec/)\\n- [Redis Cluster Scaling](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/)\\n## Glossary\\n[Section titled “Glossary”](#glossary)\\n**cluster**: A set of Redis nodes running in cluster-enabled mode. In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., cluster_slots_pfail:0\\ncluster_slots_fail:0\\ncluster_known_nodes:12\\ncluster_size:4\\n```\\n## Enable `debug` command on Redis Cluster\\n[Section titled “Enable debug command on Redis Cluster”](#enable-debug-command-on-redis-cluster)\\nAs mentioned in the beginning, most of the existing Redis Clusters do not have `debug` command enabled, which is needed to fix the cluster state as part of troubleshooting broken cluster.\\nThis step will enable the `debug` command by reconfiguring the existing Redis processes. Previous CR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18043).\\nRun this from chef-repo, to find the existing Redis servers and reconfigure them via `redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh` in the runbooks repository, excluding new shard as it was configured already with `enable-debug-command` above during provisioning.\\nCaution\\n`enable-debug-command` config option must already be enabled for newly added nodes during the time of provisioning otherwise failover wouldn’t work, which is required for reconfiguring the Redis process. Failover requires at least one keyslot to be present on the shard.\\nCaution\\nBefore running `scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh`, check the content of `$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt` for any `knife` logs, remove such lines if any.\\n```\\n# cd chef-repo\\nknife search -i \"roles:$ENV-base-db-$DEPLOYMENT\" | sort -V | grep -v $SHARD_NUMBER > /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n# cd runbooks\\nscripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n```\\n## Scale out cluster by resharding Redis keys\\n[Section titled “Scale out cluster by resharding Redis keys”](#scale-out-cluster-by-resharding-redis-keys)\\nThe goal here is to distribute the number of keyslots among all shards equally (With some rounding off). By default, we have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster. Until now, we just added Redis instances for new shard to the cluster, but they do not have any Redis keys (keyslots) yet and hence they are not serving any user requests.\\nIn this phase, we will migrate some keyslots from previous Redis shards to the new shard, so that new Redis instances start load sharing with existing Redis instances and hence lower their resource (CPU/Memory) utilization. Previous CR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18061).\\n### 1. Check the current keyslot assignments\\n[Section titled “1. Check the current keyslot assignments”](#1-check-the-current-keyslot-assignments)\\nGet the existing keyslot assignments and node IDs of the master nodes in the cluster, to prepare the commands required for migrating the keyslots.\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n```\\nFor example:\\n```\\n$ sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n1) 1) (integer) 0\\n2) (integer) 5460\\n3) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\"\\n2) (integer) 6379\\n3) \"9b0828e3379a06dc5bb749a106ab2cad9e47e4e4\"\\n4) 1) \"ip\"\\n2) \"10.217.21.10\"\\n4) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-03-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\"\\n2) (integer) 6379\\n3) \"f70faccea8b3dfc3ce4cdecfaa23b5dfb0ed06b8\"\\n4) 1) \"ip\"\\n2) \"10.217.21.5\"\\n5) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-02-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\"\\n2) (integer) 6379\\n3) \"3627d1e0b5962218a29eb852716fb23e5cb71265\"\\n4) 1) \"ip\"\\n2) \"10.217.21.8\"\\n2) 1) (integer) 5461\\n2) (integer) 10922\\n3) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-02-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\", ```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot.

For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.\\n**resharding**: Migrating ownership of some hash slots from one shard to another. This is a dynamic online operation, where Redis keys are migrated between nodes. During a resharding operation, reads and writes to the keys being migrated are semantically safe but incur some extra overhead. Also, multi-key requests may temporarily fail during the transitional state. There are some documented corner cases where a failed resharding attempt must be manually completed. In our environments, because we do not intend to dynamically add/remove nodes, resharding will be a rare and planned event (e.g. when adding new nodes to the cluster for additional capacity), not a frequent automated background activity.\\nreplica migration - an optional feature that allows the cluster to dynamically reassign a replica from one master to another, to ensure all masters have at least N replicas. This feature aims to improve availability. However, it can counter-intuitively harm availability in either of 2 ways: it can lead to a master and its replicas being in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140700451)), or it can lead to accumulating a majority of masters in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140436657)). This feature can be disabled ([cluster-allow-replica-migration](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1662-L1668)) or tuned ([cluster-migration-barrier](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1642-L1660)). This is one of the topics to be addressed by scalability#2071.\\n## Observability\\n[Section titled “Observability”](#observability)\\nFor most parts, the Grafana dashboard is the same as a Sentinel-based Redis dashboard. The difference lies in:\\n1. Cluster-specific panel: This panel tracks the slot coverage and state of nodes in the cluster. The components are defined in [`libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/ff4ff9dd29ee417a4a7d1940178c3085cc25730f/libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet#L449).\\n2. `cluster_redirection` error SLI - tracks the rate of MOVED and ASK redirections. Redirections should only happen on (1) failover (requests are redirected to the new master), (2) resharding (requests are redirected to the new slot owner).\\nCross-slot errors are prevented on the application side and should not reach the servers except for pipelined operations during resharding. The volume can be tracked on logs under 2 groups of fields:\\n1. `json.redis_<functional shard>_allowed_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of [allowed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/92312944bb8a827b5d00509a5d07d0fe8ee4955d/lib/gitlab/instrumentation/redis_cluster_validator.rb#L205) cross-slot calls (i.e. commands are accounted for and are running on non-cluster-based Redis)\\n2. `json.redis_<functional_shard>_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of cross-slot commands (not accounted for or running on Redis Cluster)\\n## Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “Troubleshooting”](#troubleshooting)\\n### What is the state of the cluster?\\n[Section titled “What is the state of the cluster?”](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\nSome commands to understand the overall state:, ```\\n`CLUSTER INFO` gives a fast overview of the state.

See the [originating issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2140) for more information.\\nIn the event where the sidecar processes are not working, the SRE/EOC will need to run the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](https://redis.io/commands/cluster-failover/) command on the desired slave node to promote that node into a master.\\nRun the following command on the desired node:\\n```\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n```\\n### How to do online resharding (with warnings)?\\n[Section titled “How to do online resharding (with warnings)?”](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\nSee the [official Redis guide](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/#reshard-the-cluster).\\n### How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?\\n[Section titled “How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?”](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\nTODO\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis/redis-cluster.md)\\n[Previous\\nTroubleshooting](/redis/redis/)   [Next\\nFunctional Partitioning](/redis/redis-functional-partitioning/), - (1) is FQDN of the Redis server\\n- (2) is the port number of Redis server\\n- **(3) is the node ID of the Redis instance** and required in resharding commands\\n- (4) is IP address of Redis instance\\n### 2. Calibrate the batch size for migration\\n[Section titled “2. Calibrate the batch size for migration”](#2-calibrate-the-batch-size-for-migration)\\nAt first, make a few migrations with incrementally increasing `BATCH_SIZE`, to determine a suitable size which does not cause large CPU/memory saturation spikes on the existing Redis instances and also is fast enough to complete migration within a few hours. Larger `BATCH_SIZE` will finish faster but will consume more CPU/memory due to concurrent read/writes and also compete with user requests, specially if keys have large values e.g. `set`, `list` or any other multi-value type data.\\nDuring previous migration in `redis-cluster-ratelimiting`, a `BATCH_SIZE` of 30 was used and moving 1365 keyslots took less than [5 seconds](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18061#note_1924076365).\\nVariables that need to be replaced in command below are:\\n- `FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **from** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `TO_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **to** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE`: number of keyslots to be migrated\\n- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of redis keys to be read and written from one master to another\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n# Trial runs to move some keyslots with batch size 30 to get time taken and its impact on CPU/Memory utilization\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nAt the same time, keep an eye on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. Also, note the time taken for migration of keyslots to estimate required time for completing the migration. If there is no impact on resources and time taken by migration is not reasonable, then try increasing the `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` to a workable number.\\n### 3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard\\n[Section titled “3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard”](#3-migrate-keys-from-existing-shards-to-new-shard)\\nWe have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster and a cluster with 3 shards have distribution like following:\\n1. First shard: 0-5460\\n2. Second shard: 5461-10922\\n3. Third shard: 10923-16383\\nIn this case, a new fourth shard will intake equal number of keyslots from all 3 existing shards, so 1365 keyslots from each (after round off).\\nOnce `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` have been determined, migrate the keyslots from each of existing shards to the new shard using:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nKeep a check on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```]

memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over. This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1> - Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example: Terminal window ``` $ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master 2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec') ``` #### Redis Sentinel [Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel), <2-hop>\\n\\n[Domain Registration](/uncategorized/domain-registration/) -

[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition) Redis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done. In the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well. The other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system. ## Timing [Section titled “Timing”](#timing) The last two redis partitions that we have done took between 3 - 6 weeks to complete. The main factors that slow down or speed up the time required are the availability of reviewers for MRs, particularly for the application changes. In general, tamland forecasts capacity out approximately three months, which should give us adequate time to partition if required. ## Determining what to split off [Section titled “Determining what to split off”](#determining-what-to-split-off) This is more of an art than a science, as it will require some amount of knowledge of the usage patterns of the redis in question. We have documented how to [analyze memory usage](../redis#redis-memory-analyzer) as well as [keyspace usage and network traffic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md#keyspace-pattern-analysis), all of which can be combined to help determine what the largest chunk that makes logical sense to move is. ## Implementation [Section titled “Implementation”](#implementation) A lot of these processes are still a work in progress and will be modified based off of the results of [the epic to lessen sharding toil](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/886). ## Application changes [Section titled “Application changes”](#application-changes) - Create a new redis store class. It should inherit from `Gitlab::Redis::Wrapper`. Configure its `config_fallback` to be the current store from which you’re sharding off this workload. - Add `use_primary_and_secondary_stores_for_<store_name>` and `use_primary_store_as_default_for_<store_name>` feature flags, matching the name of the new store. - Update the relevant client code to use the new store. [Example issue and MRs.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2149) ## Infrastructure changes [Section titled “Infrastructure changes”](#infrastructure-changes) With the [current k8s overhead due to the networking stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/16871), we can only migrate workloads that are expected to remain well under saturation threshold to Kubernetes. [See discussion points here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2130). This means that in most cases, we’ll likely be functionally sharding off onto VMs, but I’ve included the k8s documentation for when we can shift to using that more. We presently do not have a well known method of creating a redis cluster shard, but that is work in progress as well. ### VMs [Section titled “VMs”](#vms) 1. [Create a chef role](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/blob/master/roles/gprd-base-db-redis-server-db-load-balancing.json) 2. [Provision in terraform](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5009) 3. [Configure with redis-reconfigure.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/redis-reconfigure.sh) Step 1 and 2 will leave the cluster in a strange state, with each redis host believing they are the primary and a somewhat confused sentinel quorum. In order to get things back in order, you’ll need to run chef-client, gitlab-ctl reconfigure, and set each secondary to be a replica of the primary. The redis-reconfigure.sh script does this for you. Terminal]  **1. Direct Answer**\\n\\nMigration procedures for Redis sharding, including cluster setup and reconfiguration, are integral to maintaining high availability and performance, especially during failover events. Properly executing resharding and reconfiguration ensures that hash slots are evenly distributed, reducing load on individual nodes, and that failover events (like master node failures) are handled smoothly through automatic or manual master promotion. Monitoring master switch logs and redirection errors (e.g., MOVED, ASK) helps verify that failovers are correctly propagated and that clients are redirected appropriately, minimizing downtime and performance degradation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions**\\n\\n**A. Cluster Setup & Reconfiguration**\\n\\n1. **Initialize a New Cluster (if needed):**\\n   - Follow the [official Redis guide](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/#create-a-redis-cluster) to create a new cluster.\\n   - Use `redis-cli --cluster create` with the appropriate nodes.\\n\\n2. **Enable Debug Commands for Troubleshooting:**\\n   - Reconfigure existing nodes to enable `debug` commands:\\n     - Run `scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh` on each node (excluding newly provisioned nodes).\\n     - Ensure `enable-debug-command` is enabled during provisioning for new nodes.\\n     - Verify the configuration change before proceeding.\\n\\n3. **Resharding (Scaling Out):**\\n   - Check current keyslot assignments:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n     ```\\n   - Determine the number of keyslots to migrate to new nodes.\\n   - Calibrate `BATCH_SIZE` by trial runs:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard <host>:<port> --cluster-from <NODE_ID> --cluster-to <NEW_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <SLOTS> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n     ```\\n   - Migrate keyslots from existing shards to new shard:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard <host>:<port> --cluster-from <NODE_ID> --cluster-to <NEW_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <SLOTS> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n     ```\\n   - Repeat as needed until load is balanced.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**B. Handling Failover Events & Master Switch Logs**\\n\\n1. **Monitor Cluster State:**\\n   - Regularly run:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli cluster info\\n     ```\\n     - Ensure `cluster_state:ok` and `cluster_slots_ok:16384`.\\n   - Check logs for master switch events:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli --cluster info\\n     ```\\n     - Look for `cluster_known_nodes`, `cluster_size`, and failover logs.\\n\\n2. **Responding to Failures:**\\n   - If a master fails:\\n     - Confirm the failure via logs and `CLUSTER INFO`.\\n     - If automatic failover does not occur, manually promote a replica:\\n       ```\\n       sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n       ```\\n   - Verify the promotion:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli cluster nodes\\n     ```\\n     - Confirm the new master role.\\n\\n3. **Verify Redirection & Logs:**\\n   - Check for `MOVED` or `ASK` redirection errors:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli --cluster info\\n     ```\\n   - These indicate client redirection due to failover or resharding.\\n   - Ensure clients are correctly redirected and the cluster state remains `ok`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands**\\n\\n- **Check cluster info:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli cluster info\\n  ```\\n- **Check slot assignments:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n  ```\\n- **Reshard keyslots:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard <host>:<port> --cluster-from <NODE_ID> --cluster-to <NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <SLOTS> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n  ```\\n- **Force master promotion (emergency):**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n  ```\\n- **Fix hanging keyslot after interrupted migration:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli --cluster fix <host>:<port>\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes**\\n\\n- **Prerequisites:**\\n  - Ensure `enable-debug-command` is enabled before reconfiguration.\\n  - Backup cluster configuration and data before resharding.\\n  - Monitor resource utilization during resharding to prevent overload.\\n- **Warnings:**\\n  - Resharding can temporarily cause cross-slot errors and request redirections.\\n  - Killing a migration process may leave keyslots in a \"migrating\" state; run `--cluster fix` to recover.\\n  - Failover promotion should be performed only when necessary; manual promotion can cause data inconsistency if not carefully managed.\\n- **Additional Context:**\\n  - Regularly review logs for master switch events to confirm failover success.\\n  - Use observability dashboards to track redirection errors (`cluster_redirection`) and cross-slot calls.\\n  - Properly balancing hash slots and monitoring failover logs are key to maintaining high availability and performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis structured approach ensures that Redis sharding, cluster reconfiguration, and failover handling work cohesively to sustain high availability and optimal performance.                                                                                                                                                                   Migration procedures for Redis sharding, such as setting up clusters and reconfiguring nodes, are essential for distributing workload and achieving horizontal scaling, which directly impacts high availability and performance. Proper cluster setup ensures that Redis instances can failover seamlessly during failover events, with master switch logs providing critical information about role changes and failover occurrences. By combining effective sharding migration techniques with vigilant monitoring of master switch logs, infrastructure engineers can maintain Redis high availability, quickly respond to failover events, and optimize performance within complex infrastructure setups.      0.883721          0.826870                1.0        1.000000            0.947386               0.090909\n",

NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial>\\nFrom time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes.\\nSo, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take:\\n1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`\\n- This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel\\n2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel`\\n- Not sure why, but it’s minor\\n3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master:\\n1.

So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status.\\nIt’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time.\\n### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)\\n[Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis)\\nsee: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md>\\n### Replication issues\\n[Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues)\\n#### Possible checks\\n[Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks)\\n#### client-output-buffer-limit\\n[Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit)\\ncheck Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf>\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n> config get client-output-buffer-limit\\n```\\n#### Checks Using Prometheus\\n[Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus)\\n##### Redis Primaries\\n[Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries)\\nList the Redis primaries using:\\n- [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1)\\n##### Redis Secondaries, manage the data/expiry (no client activity required; old data just ages out)\\nIt is *not* a service to rate limit requests to Redis itself.\\nThis Redis instance was split off from `redis-cache` because as found in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/3034#note_460538394> RackAttack\\nalone accounted for somewhere in the order of 25% (absolute) CPU usage on the redis-cache instance in Nov 2020, and that will\\nonly have grown with traffic.\\nAs the cache cluster approached 95% saturation it was determined the best short-term approach was to split out the rate-limiting\\ndata storage to its own cluster before we go further with more horizontal scalability.\\nThe `redis-cluster-ratelimiting` instance is the horizontally scalable\\ncounterpart of `redis-ratelimiting` whichs runs in Sentinel mode.

You then assign replicas to masters with `cluster replicate`. Use `CLUSTER INFO`, `CLUSTER SLOTS`, and `CLUSTER SLAVES` to monitor and verify the cluster health at 1-hop (local node) and 2-hop (neighbor nodes) levels. Proper validation and careful reconfiguration ensure a healthy, scalable Redis cluster.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. **Step-by-Step Instructions**\\n\\n### **A. Prepare New Nodes for Scaling**\\n\\n1. **Provision new Redis nodes** (VMs or containers) with Redis installed and configured for cluster mode.\\n2. **Ensure network connectivity** between existing cluster nodes and new nodes.\\n\\n### **B. Add New Nodes to the Cluster (1-Hop & 2-Hop Management)**\\n\\n1. **Identify the existing master node** to which you will connect the new node:\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <existing-master-FQDN/IP>\\n   ```\\n2. **Add the new node as a master**:\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\\\n   <new-node-FQDN/IP>:6379 \\\\n   <existing-master-FQDN/IP>:6379\\n   ```\\n3. **Add additional nodes (slaves/replicas)**:\\n   - For each replica, run:\\n   ```bash\\n   master_node_id=$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster nodes | grep <existing-master-FQDN/IP> | awk '{ print $1 }')\\n   sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\\\n   <replica-node-FQDN/IP>:6379 \\\\n   <existing-master-FQDN/IP>:6379 \\\\n   --cluster-slave --cluster-master-id $master_node_id\\n   ```\\n4. **Repeat** for all nodes in the new shard or replica set.\\n\\n### **C. Manage and Verify Cluster State (1-Hop & 2-Hop Info)**\\n\\n1. **Check overall cluster health**:\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <any-node-FQDN/IP>\\n   ```\\n   Confirm:\\n   - `cluster_state:ok`\\n   - `cluster_slots_ok:16384`\\n2. **Inspect slot distribution**:\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster slots <any-node-FQDN/IP>\\n   ```\\n   Verify all slots are assigned and balanced.\\n3. **Check slave (replica) info**:\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster slaves <node-id>\\n   ```\\n   Confirm replicas are connected and synchronized.\\n\\n### **D. Resharding (if needed)**\\n\\n- Use the online resharding procedure from the [Redis official guide](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/#reshard-the-cluster), being aware of the warnings.\\n\\n### **E. Validation**\\n\\n1. **Wait for gossip to propagate** (a few seconds).\\n2. **Recheck cluster info**:\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <any-node-FQDN/IP>\\n   ```\\n3. **Ensure all nodes report `cluster_state:ok`** and all slots are assigned.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. **Key Commands**\\n\\n| Action | Command |\\n|---------|---------|\\n| Add node to cluster | `sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node <new-node>:6379 <existing-node>:6379` |\\n| Add replica to master | `cluster replicate <node-id>` (via `--cluster add-node --cluster-slave`) | \\n| Check cluster info | `sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <node>` |\\n| Check slot distribution | `sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster slots <node>` |\\n| List slaves of a node | `sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster slaves <node-id>` |\\n| Promote a replica (failover) | `sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER` |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. **Important Notes**\\n\\n- **Ensure network connectivity** between all nodes before adding them.\\n- **Perform validation** after each step to confirm cluster health.\\n- **Balance slots** if necessary, using online resharding.\\n- **Monitor cluster state** continuously via `CLUSTER INFO` and `CLUSTER SLOTS`.\\n- **Be cautious** during resharding or reconfiguration to avoid data loss or cluster instability.\\n- **Use `cluster-reconfigure.sh`** if you need to reconfigure existing nodes with debug commands or other settings.\\n- **Prerequisites**: Proper permissions, network access, and existing cluster health.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis structured approach ensures safe scaling and management of your Redis cluster from both 1-hop and 2-hop perspectives, maintaining high availability and balanced data distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      to scale up redis cluster and manage nodes, you need to create or recreate clusters from snapshots as described in the 1-hop context, and also perform scaling, upgrades, and maintenance activities outlined in the 2-hop context, such as geo patroni cluster management and managing redis cluster features, ensuring proper provisioning and management of redis nodes.      0.644737          0.762534                1.0        0.000000            0.232048               0.000000\n",

Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude.\\nThe current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce.\\n**Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!**\\nTerminal window\\n```\\nrm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb\\n```\\n#### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis\\n[Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis)\\n### CPU profiling\\n[Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling)\\nCPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck.\\nA profile can be captured via perf:\\nTerminal window\\n```\\nsudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER\\ncd /var/log/perf-$USER\\nsudo chown $USER:$USER .\\nsudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300\\nsudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz\\nsudo rm perf.data\\n```\\nThis will sample stacks at ~500hz.\\nThose stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph).\\nTerminal window\\n```\\nscp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz .\\ncat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg\\n```\\n### Accessing Redis via the Rails console\\n[Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console)\\nSometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails\\nconsole. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run\\n`redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier\\nexpressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`.\\nYou probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you\\ninstantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary:\\n```\\nredis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave))\\n```\\nSubstitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client\\nfor the respective Redis instance.\\n### packetbeat\\n[Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat)\\nTODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat>\\n### Profiling the application\\n[Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application)\\nTODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940>\\n## Failover and Recovery procedures\\n[Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures)\\n### Accessing the Redis console\\n[Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console)\\nBe extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime.\\nRedis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf)\\ninteractive:\\n```\\nREDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli\\n```\\nor oneliners:\\n```\\nREDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10\\n```\\n### Building a new Redis server and starting replication, primary fails (as determined by Sentinel), one of the replicas is promoted to primary.\\nClients are configured to connect to the sentinels which will then direct them to the current primary; there is no load\\nbalancer involved in this path. Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., ```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n1)  1) \"name\"\\n2) \"gstg-redis-cache\"        # cluster_id\\n3) \"ip\"\\n4) \"10.224.8.103\"            # ip address of the current master\\n5) \"port\"\\n6) \"6379\"\\n7) \"runid\"\\n8) \"06277f7abca059c268b2c5e2b2581d7d3bf330f1\"\\n9) \"flags\"\\n10) \"master\"\\n11) \"link-pending-commands\"\\n12) \"0\"\\n13) \"link-refcount\"\\n14) \"1\"\\n15) \"last-ping-sent\"\\n16) \"0\"\\n17) \"last-ok-ping-reply\"\\n18) \"440\"\\n19) \"last-ping-reply\"\\n20) \"440\"\\n21) \"down-after-milliseconds\"\\n22) \"10000\"\\n23) \"info-refresh\"\\n24) \"9021\"\\n25) \"role-reported\"\\n26) \"master\"\\n27) \"role-reported-time\"\\n28) \"956691745\"\\n29) \"config-epoch\"\\n30) \"51\"\\n31) \"num-slaves\"\\n32) \"2\"\\n33) \"num-other-sentinels\"\\n34) \"2\"\\n35) \"quorum\"\\n36) \"2\"\\n37) \"failover-timeout\"\\n38) \"60000\"\\n39) \"parallel-syncs\"\\n40) \"1\"\\n```\\n1.

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., ```\\n`CLUSTER INFO` gives a fast overview of the state. If `cluster_state:ok` and `cluster_slots_ok:16384` are present, the cluster is likely to be fine.\\n```\\n➜  ~ redis-cli cluster info\\ncluster_state:ok\\ncluster_slots_assigned:16384\\ncluster_slots_ok:16384\\ncluster_slots_pfail:0\\ncluster_slots_fail:0\\ncluster_known_nodes:9\\ncluster_size:3\\n```\\n`CLUSTER SLAVES <node id>` provides shard-based information when wanting to drill down to a specific master node.\\n```\\n➜  ~ redis-cli -p 7001 cluster slaves 97d7d00217fb53b9f4f74763f04be50c536dc470\\n1) \"4ccb0580c355ff37d54665f7f60fe00a5ee9a6c9 127.0.0.1:7202@17202,localhost slave 97d7d00217fb53b9f4f74763f04be50c536dc470 0 1678417677554 8 connected\"\\n2) \"03f7a03ea54ad3d0f8e079e1e63422ec0735046f 127.0.0.1:7203@17203,localhost slave 97d7d00217fb53b9f4f74763f04be50c536dc470 0 1678417677000 8 connected\"`\\n```\\nTo avoid an erroneous single-sided view, the command should be performed on at least 1 nodes from each shards.\\nFor slot health, use `CLUSTER SLOTS` or `CLUSTER SHARDS`.\\n### How to initialize a new cluster\\n[Section titled “How to initialize a new cluster”](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\nTo initialize a cluster, see the [official Redis guide](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/#create-a-redis-cluster).\\nAn example of how previous clusters were set up can be found in [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2210#note_1287069028).\\n### How to recover from all nodes going down\\n[Section titled “How to recover from all nodes going down”](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\nAs the [gitlab-redis-cluster cookbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab-redis-cluster/-/blob/3dd0f008677d7e85121fe659428adcfc1277e904/attributes/default.rb#L14) defines a `cluster-config-file`, the nodes will attempt to recreate the original cluster topology using previously stored information from the file after a restart.\\n### How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself\\n[Section titled “How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself”](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\nThere is a sidecar process in each VM which checks the cluster health and forces a failover.

[Section titled “Is redis running?”](#is-redis-running) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana) Grafana dashboards: - [redis](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-main/redis-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-cache](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sidekiq](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-tracechunks](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-tracechunks-main/redis-tracechunks-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-ratelimiting](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-ratelimiting-main/redis-ratelimiting-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sessions](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sessions-main/redis-sessions-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) For example, there is a Grafana chart showing number of slowlog events in redis-sidekiq (not linking it here because the panel ID changes when Grafana dashboards are deployed). ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos) <https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1w&g0.expr=redis_up%20%3C%201&g0.tab=0> ### directly on a redis host [Section titled “directly on a redis host”](#directly-on-a-redis-host) - is redis up? - `gitlab-ctl status` - can we dial redis? - `telnet localhost 6379` - can we talk to redis via `redis-cli`? ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info ``` ## How to get redis stats? [Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1) [see above](#grafana) ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1) Redis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` . It is scraped by Prometheus. See [the exporter documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) for more details. [Example `redis_exporter` metric](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=redis_commands_processed_total&g0.tab=1) in Thanos. ### redis-cli [Section titled “redis-cli”](#redis-cli) Run: - [INFO command](https://redis.io/commands/info) - [MEMORY\\_STATS command](https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats) NOTE: DO NOT USE [MONITOR] COMMAND! It streams back every command processed by the Redis server which can double the use of resources. It can overload a production machine making it unresponsive or causing an OOM kill. NOTE: DO NOT USE [KEYS] COMMAND! It will overload a production machine. ## What is causing Redis to slowdown? [Section titled “What is causing Redis to slowdown?”](#what-is-causing-redis-to-slowdown) The application relies on Redis throughput to be very high, latency spikes can be detrimental to the operation of the entire application. ### Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana”](#prometheusthanosgrafana) Explore Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana. Historical metrics might suggest a sudden change in the application behavior or traffic, for example: - operations rate, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=54> - keys rate of change, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=64> For Grafana links [see above](#grafana). ### slowlog [Section titled “slowlog”](#slowlog) The slowlog records slow Redis queries. Redis [SLOWLOG command documentation](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog). Get top 10 Redis slowlog entries: Terminal window ``` > slowlog get 10 1) 1) (integer) 5100 # A unique progressive identifier for every slow log entry. 2) (integer) 1561019091 # The unix timestamp at which the logged command was processed. 3) (integer) 21390 # The amount of time needed for its execution, in microseconds. 4) 1) \"del\" # The array composing the arguments of the command. 2) \"cache:gitlab:242234:8213877:Ci::CompareTestReportsService\" ``` To convert the timestamp, use `date -d @1561019091`. Get the command execution time threshold at which commands are logged (in microseconds): ``` > config get slowlog-log-slower-than ``` Get size of slowlog (entries are discarded like in a FIFO queue): ``` > config get slowlog-max-len ``` #### Monitoring number of slowlog entries [Section titled “Monitoring number of slowlog entries”](#monitoring-number-of-slowlog-entries) The number of entries added to the slowlog is exposed as a Prometheus metric and [there is a Grafana chart for it](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=48). #### Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog [Section titled “Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog”](#monitoring-the-rate-of-change-in-the-slowlog) A useful metric for monitoring potential slow-downs in Redis is measuring the rate of change in the `redis_slowlog_last_id`. This can be done by plotting (`changes(redis_slowlog_last_id[1h])`](../<https://prometheus.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1d&g0.expr=changes(redis_slowlog_last_id%5B1h%5D)&g0.tab=0>). ### Redis latency monitoring framework [Section titled “Redis latency monitoring framework”](#redis-latency-monitoring-framework) Redis provides a latency diagnostic tool: <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> You may need to enable it with `CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100`. From <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> : By default monitoring is disabled (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. However while the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well. #### LATENCY DOCTOR [Section titled “LATENCY DOCTOR”](#latency-doctor) Terminal window ``` > CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100 > LATENCY DOCTOR Dave, I have observed latency spikes in this Redis instance. You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave? 1. command: 5 latency spikes (average 300ms, mean deviation 120ms, period 73.40 sec). Worst all time event 500ms. I have a few advices for you: - Your current Slow Log configuration only logs events that are slower than your configured latency monitor threshold. Please use 'CONFIG, <2-hop>\\n\\npresented are an optimistic estimate, as redis will require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over. This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1> - Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example: Terminal window ``` $ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master 2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec') ``` #### Redis Sentinel [Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            **1. Direct Answer:**\\n\\nFailover and recovery procedures are essential in troubleshooting Redis slowdown causes and replication issues because they help identify, isolate, and restore Redis instances that are overwhelmed, unresponsive, or experiencing network or node failures. Proper failover procedures ensure that a healthy replica is promoted to primary if the current primary is slow or unresponsive, preventing prolonged latency or downtime. Recovery procedures also help re-establish replication, fix configuration issues, and restore cluster health, thereby reducing the impact of slowdowns and replication problems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2.

Troubleshooting Redis Slowdown Causes\\n\\n1. **Identify the Issue:**\\n   - Use CPU profiling (`perf record`) to check for CPU saturation.\\n   - Check Redis logs and Sentinel logs for signs of failover or network issues.\\n   - Monitor Redis response times and client request queues.\\n\\n2. **Assess if Failover is Needed:**\\n   - If Redis is slow and Sentinel detects unresponsiveness (e.g., `PING` timeout > `down-after-milliseconds`), a failover might be triggered.\\n   - Confirm if the primary is overwhelmed or unresponsive.\\n\\n3. **Perform Failover if Necessary:**\\n   - Run the Sentinel failover command:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <SENTINEL_PORT> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n     ```\\n   - Or, if Sentinel is unresponsive, manually promote a replica:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n     ```\\n   - This promotes a healthy replica to primary, reducing load on the overwhelmed node.\\n\\n4. **Monitor the New Primary:**\\n   - Check cluster health with:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli cluster info\\n     ```\\n   - Ensure `cluster_state:ok` and all slots are assigned.\\n\\n5. **Investigate Underlying Causes:**\\n   - Check for large requests, microbursts, or network issues.\\n   - Use CPU profiling and Redis slowlog to identify expensive commands.\\n\\n### B. Troubleshooting Replication Issues\\n\\n1. **Check Replication Status:**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli INFO replication\\n     ```\\n   - Look for `role:master` or `role:slave`, and verify replication lag or errors.\\n\\n2. **Identify Flapping or Desynchronization:**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli --bigkeys\\n     ```\\n   - Check for large output buffers or high latency commands.\\n\\n3. **Fix Replication Problems:**\\n   - If replication is stuck or lagging, consider resynchronizing:\\n     - Restart the replica.\\n     - Or, reconfigure replication:\\n       ```\\n       redis-cli REPLICAOF <master_ip> <master_port>\\n       ```\\n   - Check for network issues or resource constraints.\\n\\n4. **Use Failover or Promotion if Needed:**\\n   - If a replica is out of sync or slow, promote it:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n     ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands:**\\n\\n| Purpose | Command |\\n|---------|---------|\\n| Check cluster info | `redis-cli cluster info` |\\n| Failover via Sentinel | `/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <SENTINEL_PORT> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>` |\\n| Promote replica manually | `sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER` |\\n| Check replication status | `redis-cli INFO replication` |\\n| Resynchronize replica | `redis-cli REPLICAOF <master_ip> <master_port>` |\\n| Check slowlog | `REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10` |\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n\\n- **Caution with Commands:** Commands like `KEYS` or `MONITOR` can lock Redis and cause downtime. Use them carefully during troubleshooting.\\n- **Failover Timing:** Failover can be triggered automatically by Sentinel if Redis is unresponsive, but manual intervention may be necessary if Sentinel is unresponsive.\\n- **Cluster State:** Always verify cluster health after failover or recovery with `CLUSTER INFO`.\\n- **Resource Constraints:** Slowdowns often stem from CPU saturation, memory issues, or network problems. Use profiling tools to diagnose.\\n- **Configuration Checks:** Ensure `maxmemory`, `client-output-buffer-limit`, and other configs are appropriate and not causing issues.\\n- **Backup Data:** Remember to delete RDB files (`dump.rdb`) after recovery to prevent stale data issues, and ensure data consistency before making changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis structured approach ensures you can systematically identify, troubleshoot, and resolve Redis slowdown and replication issues using failover and recovery procedures effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Failover and recovery procedures are essential for addressing redis slowdown causes and replication issues by ensuring that Redis can quickly switch to a healthy master if the current one fails, and by restoring replication links. These procedures include building new Redis servers, starting replication with 'slaveof' commands, and using Sentinel to manage automatic failover. Properly executing these steps helps maintain high availability, reduces latency spikes, and resolves replication problems, thereby improving Redis performance and stability.      0.877193          0.956240                1.0        0.666667            0.234085               0.200000\n"
