            "Response:\n",
            "### 1. Direct Answer\n",
            "To monitor Redis memory usage effectively, you should regularly check Redis memory metrics, set up alerts for high memory consumption (especially relative to your configured limit), and monitor eviction events. Use Redis commands like `INFO MEMORY` and `MEMORY STATS`, and leverage Prometheus metrics if available. Additionally, keep an eye on `redis_evicted_keys_total` to detect potential memory saturation issues.\n",

            "### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 1: Access Redis CLI\n",
            "- Connect to your Redis instance using `redis-cli`:\n",
            "  ```bash\n",
            "  redis-cli -h <redis-host> -p <port>\n",

            "\n",
            "#### Step 2: Check Memory Usage\n",
            "- Run the `INFO MEMORY` command:\n",
            "  ```bash\n",
            "  INFO MEMORY\n",
            "  ```\n",
            "  - Review fields such as `used_memory`, `used_memory_rss`, `used_memory_peak`, and `maxmemory`.\n",
            "- Alternatively, use `MEMORY STATS`:\n",
            "  ```bash\n",
            "  MEMORY STATS\n",

[- [4. Troubleshooting](#4-troubleshooting)\\n# Provisioning Redis Cluster\\nThis document outlines the steps for provisioning a Redis Cluster. Former attempts are documented here:\\n- [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256)\\n- [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358)\\n## Setting up instances\\n[Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances)\\nFirst, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely:\\n- `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd`\\n- `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1`\\n- `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag`\\n- `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`)\\n- `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag`\\n- `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`.\\n- `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\nWhen configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application.\\nE.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes.\\n**Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand.\\n### 1. Generate Redis passwords\\n[Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\nGenerate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using:\\n```\\nfor I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n```\\nUpdate both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master):\\n```\\n./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n```\\nUpdate the JSON payload to include the new instance details:\\n```\\n{\\n...,\\n\"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n\"redis_conf\": {\\n\"masteruser\": \"replica\",\\n\"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n\"user\": [\\n\"default off\",\\n\"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n\"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\",\\n\"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\",\\n\"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\"\\n]\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n```\\nDo the same for\\n```\\n./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n```\\nModify the existing JSON\\n```\\n{\\n\"redis_exporter\": {\\n\"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n\"env\": {\\n\"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\"\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n```, mv data.json.tmp data.json\\nvault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\nrm data.json\\nOR\\nglsh vault edit-secret chef env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets\\n#  Add the following object in .\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override :\\n#  \"<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>\": {\\n#    \"password\": <RAILS_REDACTED>\\n#  }\\n```\\nUpdate roles/-base.json with the relevant connection details. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3546).\\n### 2. Verification of config in a VM\\n[Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm)\\nCheck the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference.\\n```\\n[ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME>\\n=> \"PONG\"\\n[ gstg ] production>\\n```\\n### 3. Configure Gitlab Rails\\n[Section titled “3. Configure Gitlab Rails”](#3-configure-gitlab-rails)\\na. Update secret\\n```\\nvault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED>\\n```\\nFor example,\\n```\\nvault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\n======================== Secret Path ========================\\nk8s/data/env/gprd/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-rails\\n======= Metadata =======\\nKey                Value\\n---                -----\\ncreated_time       2023-03-18T00:33:29.790293426Z\\ncustom_metadata    <nil>\\ndeletion_time      n/a\\ndestroyed          false\\nversion            1\\n====== Data ======\\nKey         Value\\n---         -----\\npassword    <RAILS_REDACTED>\\n```\\nNote the version of the password in `vault kv get` and make sure it tallies with the external secret definition in [k8s-workload](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/master/releases/gitlab-external-secrets/values/values.yaml.gotmpl):\\n```\\ngitlab-redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails-credential-v1:\\nrefreshInterval: 0\\nsecretStoreName: gitlab-secrets\\ntarget:\\ncreationPolicy: Owner\\ndeletionPolicy: Delete\\ndata:\\n- remoteRef:\\nkey: env/{{ $env }}/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\nproperty: password\\nversion: \"1\"\\nsecretKey: password\\n```\\nNote that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets).\\nb.

Former attempts are documented here: - [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256) - [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358) ## Setting up instances [Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances) First, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely: - `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd` - `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1` - `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag` - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`) - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag` - `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`. - `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) When configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application. E.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes. **Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand. ### 1. Generate Redis passwords [Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords) Generate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using: ``` for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done ``` Update both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master): ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV> ``` Update the JSON payload to include the new instance details: ``` { ..., \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"redis_conf\": { \"masteruser\": \"replica\", \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"user\": [ \"default off\", \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\", \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\", \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\" ] } } } ``` Do the same for ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV> ``` Modify the existing JSON ``` { \"redis_exporter\": { \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"env\": { \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\" } } } } ``` ### 2. Create Chef roles [Section titled “2. Create Chef roles”](#2-create-chef-roles) Set the new chef roles and add the new role to the list of gitlab-redis roles in -infra-prometheus-server role. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3494). ### 3. Provision VMs [Section titled “3. Provision VMs”](#3-provision-vms) Provision the VMs via the generic-stor/google terraform module. This is done in the [config-mgmt project in the ops environment](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/). An example MR can be found [here](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5811). After the MR is merged and applied, check the VM state via: ``` gcloud compute instances list --project <GCP_PROJECT> | grep 'redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>' ``` You need to wait for the initial chef-client run to complete. One way to check is to tail the serial port output to check when the initial run is completed. An example: ``` gcloud compute --project=<GCP_PROJECT> instances tail-serial-port-output redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV> --zone us-east1-{c/b/d} ``` ### 4. Initialising the cluster [Section titled “4. Initialising the cluster”](#4-initialising-the-cluster) a. SSH into one of the instance: ``` ssh redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV>.c.<GCP_PROJECT>.internal ``` b. Run the following: ``` export ENV=<ENV> export PROJECT=<GCP_PROJECT> export DEPLOYMENT=redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE> ``` c. Use the following command to connect the master-nodes and initialise a working cluster. Add more shard FQDN where necessary. e.g. `$DEPLOYMENT-shard-<shard_number>-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379`. ``` sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster create \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-02-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-03-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 ``` Use the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..m}` where `n` is the number of shards and `m` is the number of instances per shard. ``` for i in {01,02,03}-{02,03}; do sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 sleep 2 done ``` Use the following command, to assign the replicas within each shard. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..n}` where necessary depending on the cluster-size. ``` for i in {01,02,03}; do for j in {02,03}; do node_id=\"$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster nodes | grep $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal | awk '{ print $1 }')\"; sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-$j-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal \\ cluster replicate $node_id done done ``` ### 5. Validation [Section titled “5. Validation”](#5-validation) Wait for a few seconds as the nodes need time to gossip. Check the status via: ``` $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal:6379 (9b0828e3...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.3:6379 (ac03fcee...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.4:6379 (f8341afd...) -> 0 keys | 5462 slots | 2 slaves. [OK] 0 keys in 3 masters. 0.00 keys per slot on average. $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster info | head -n7 cluster_state:ok cluster_slots_assigned:16384 cluster_slots_ok:16384 cluster_slots_pfail:0 cluster_slots_fail:0 cluster_known_nodes:9 cluster_size:3 ``` ## Configuring the applications [Section titled “Configuring the applications”](#configuring-the-applications) ### 1. Configure console instances [Section titled “1. Configure console instances”](#1-configure-console-instances) a. Proxy and authenticate to Hashicorp Vault: ``` glsh vault proxy export VAULT_PROXY_ADDR=\"socks5://localhost:18200\" glsh vault login ``` ``` vault kv get -format=json chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets | jq '.data.data' > data.json cat data.json | jq --arg PASSWORD <RAILS_REDACTED> '.\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>.password = $PASSWORD' > data.json.tmp diff -u data.json data.json.tmp mv data.json.tmp data.json vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json rm data.json OR glsh vault edit-secret chef env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets # Add the following object in .\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override : # \"<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>\": { # \"password\": <RAILS_REDACTED> # } ``` Update roles/-base.json with the relevant connection details.

Direct Answer:**\\n\\nHashicorp Vault is used to securely store, manage, and rotate Redis cluster passwords. It acts as a centralized secrets management system, ensuring that Redis credentials are kept confidential, versioned, and easily retrievable by authorized systems and personnel, thereby enhancing security and operational control.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n**a. Generate Redis Passwords:**\\n1. Use OpenSSL to create four secure passwords:\\n   ```\\n   for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n   ```\\n2. Store these passwords securely for subsequent use.\\n\\n**b. Update Vault Secrets for Redis:**\\n3. Use `gkms-vault-edit` to update the `redis-cluster` secret:\\n   ```\\n   ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n   ```\\n4. Modify the JSON payload to include the new passwords and configuration, then patch the secret:\\n   ```\\n   vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n   ```\\n5. Repeat for `redis-exporter`:\\n   ```\\n   ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n   ```\\n   Update the secret with the `EXPORTER_REDACTED` password.\\n\\n**c. Apply Secrets to Configuration Files:**\\n6. Use `vault kv` commands or `glsh vault` to retrieve and update the secrets in the application's configuration:\\n   ```\\n   vault kv get -format=json chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets | jq ...\\n   ```\\n7. Insert the new passwords into the relevant configuration objects, then patch the secret:\\n   ```\\n   vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n   ```\\n\\n**d. Update Kubernetes Secrets:**\\n8. Use the secret version (e.g., `v1`) in the Kubernetes external secrets configuration to ensure the application retrieves the latest credentials.\\n\\n**e. Configure Application to Use Vault Secrets:**\\n9. Update the application's configuration (e.g., `gitlab.rb`, `values.yaml`) to reference the Vault secrets, ensuring the application can authenticate and fetch the Redis credentials securely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands:**\\n\\n- Generate passwords:\\n  ```\\n  for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n  ```\\n- Update Vault secrets:\\n  ```\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n  ```\\n- Patch secrets:\\n  ```\\n  vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n  ```\\n- Retrieve secrets:\\n  ```\\n  vault kv get -format=json chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets\\n  ```\\n- Verify Redis connection:\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <node_address>\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n\\n- Always generate strong, unique passwords and store them securely.\\n- Use `gkms-vault-edit` to update secrets in Vault, ensuring version control and auditability.\\n- When rotating secrets, follow the controlled rollout process to prevent service disruption.\\n- Ensure the application configuration references the correct Vault secret version.\\n- Verify the configuration in a VM before deploying to production to prevent misconfigurations.\\n- Vault centralizes secret management, reducing the risk of credential leaks and simplifying secret rotation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\nHashicorp Vault provides a secure, centralized platform for managing Redis passwords, enabling safe storage, controlled rotation, and seamless retrieval by applications and infrastructure components.

It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability). It’s not a full DBMS with\\nguaranteed write semantics (and performance implications to match), but it is sufficiently persistent that there wouldn’t, Note that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets).\\nb. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly.\\nEither add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2753).\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n#### No metrics on dashboard\\n[Section titled “No metrics on dashboard”](#no-metrics-on-dashboard)\\nThis was encountered when provisioning the [production instance of redis-cluster-chat-cache](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358#note_1406105979).

Verification of config in a VM [Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm) Check the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference. ``` [ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME> => \"PONG\" [ gstg ] production> ``` ### 3. Configure Gitlab Rails [Section titled “3. Configure Gitlab Rails”](#3-configure-gitlab-rails) a. Update secret ``` vault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED> ``` For example, ``` vault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails ======================== Secret Path ======================== k8s/data/env/gprd/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-rails ======= Metadata ======= Key Value --- ----- created_time 2023-03-18T00:33:29.790293426Z custom_metadata <nil> deletion_time n/a destroyed false version 1 ====== Data ====== Key Value --- ----- password <RAILS_REDACTED> ``` Note the version of the password in `vault kv get` and make sure it tallies with the external secret definition in [k8s-workload](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/master/releases/gitlab-external-secrets/values/values.yaml.gotmpl): ``` gitlab-redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails-credential-v1: refreshInterval: 0 secretStoreName: gitlab-secrets target: creationPolicy: Owner deletionPolicy: Delete data: - remoteRef: key: env/{{ $env }}/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails property: password version: \"1\" secretKey: password ``` Note that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets). b. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly. Either add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`.

Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting) #### No metrics on dashboard [Section titled “No metrics on dashboard”](#no-metrics-on-dashboard) This was encountered when provisioning the [production instance of redis-cluster-chat-cache](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358#note_1406105979). To resolve this, run chef-repo on Prometheus with: ``` knife ssh roles:gprd-infra-prometheus-server \"sudo chef-client\" ``` [Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis/provisioning-redis-cluster.md) [Previous Memory space analysis with cupcake-rdb](/redis/memory-space-analysis-cupcake-rdb/) [Next Troubleshooting](/redis/redis/)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ### 1. Direct Answer\\nBased on the provided runbook documentation, GitLab **does not** directly manage Redis configurations through a dedicated configuration management system or external tool. Instead, Redis configurations are managed via configuration files (e.g., `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf`) and controlled through GitLab's omnibus `gitlab-ctl` commands. The runbook emphasizes using `gitlab-ctl` commands (like `gitlab-ctl start redis` or `gitlab-ctl restart redis`) for Redis operations, but it does not specify GitLab as a tool for managing Redis configuration files or settings centrally.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n**To verify or modify Redis configurations in the GitLab infrastructure:**\\n\\n1. **Check the Redis configuration file:**\\n   - The main configuration is located at `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf`.\\n   - Use `sudo` to view or edit:\\n     ```\\n     sudo cat /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf\\n     ```\\n   - Or edit with:\\n     ```\\n     sudo nano /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Apply configuration changes:**\\n   - For example, to set `client-output-buffer-limit`:\\n     - Convert human-readable sizes to bytes (e.g., 4GB = 4294967296).\\n     - Use the `redis-cli` to set the config:\\n       ```\\n       REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n       /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set client-output-buffer-limit \"slave 4294967296 4294967296 0\"\\n       ```\\n   - Note: Changes made via `redis-cli config set` are temporary and will be lost on restart unless persisted in the config file.\\n\\n3. **Restart Redis after configuration changes:**\\n   - To apply persistent changes, edit the config file directly.\\n   - Restart Redis:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Monitoring and troubleshooting:**\\n   - Check logs at `/var/log/gitlab/redis/current`.\\n   - Use `gitlab-ctl` commands for service management:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-ctl status redis\\n     sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n     ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Start Redis:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl start redis\\n  ```\\n- **Restart Redis:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n  ```\\n- **Check Redis logs:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo tail -f /var/log/gitlab/redis/current\\n  ```\\n- **Set Redis configuration dynamically (temporary):**\\n  ```\\n  REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set <parameter> <value>\\n  ```\\n- **Apply configuration changes permanently:**\\n  - Edit `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf` directly, then restart Redis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **GitLab does not manage Redis configs via GitLab or external tools**; configurations are handled through the config file and `gitlab-ctl`.\\n- **Changes via `redis-cli config set` are ephemeral** and will revert after Redis restarts unless updated in the config file.\\n- Always **backup configuration files** before making changes.\\n- For **large configuration changes** (like buffer limits), convert sizes to bytes as specified in the runbook.\\n- Use `gitlab-ctl restart redis` after modifications to ensure changes take effect.\\n- Monitor logs for errors or issues after applying changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nGitLab manages Redis primarily through configuration files and `gitlab-ctl` commands. It does not use GitLab itself as a management tool for Redis configs but relies on standard configuration and service control procedures outlined in the runbook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The context mentions GitLab in relation to verifying configuration in a VM, updating secrets, and configuring GitLab Rails, indicating that GitLab is used for managing redis configurations within the infrastructure setup.      0.636364          0.916777                1.0        0.500000            0.285875                    0.0\n",

Direct Answer\\nAn SSL Certificate (Secure Sockets Layer Certificate) is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and enables encrypted communication between the server and clients. It ensures data privacy, integrity, and security during data transmission over the internet.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook Procedures)\\n\\n**Note:** The runbook documentation provided does not explicitly detail SSL certificate procedures, but general best practices and typical steps are outlined below.\\n\\n#### Step 1: Understand the Purpose of SSL Certificates\\n- Verify whether you need an SSL certificate for your domain or service.\\n- Determine if you will use a managed certificate (e.g., AWS Managed Certificates) or generate your own.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Obtain an SSL Certificate\\n- For managed services:\\n  - Navigate to the [AWS Managed Certificates](https://about.gitlab.com/certificates/aws/) documentation.\\n  - Request a certificate via the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).\\n- For self-managed certificates:\\n  - Generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) using OpenSSL or your preferred tool.\\n  - Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, etc.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Install the SSL Certificate\\n- For cloud or managed services:\\n  - Attach the obtained certificate to your load balancer, CDN, or web server as per the provider's instructions.\\n- For self-managed servers:\\n  - Upload the certificate files (certificate, private key, CA bundle) to your server.\\n  - Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to use these certificates.\\n\\n#### Step 4: Configure Your Web Server\\n- Update your server configuration to enable SSL:\\n  - For Nginx:\\n    ```bash\\n    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;\\n    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;\\n    ```\\n  - For Apache:\\n    ```apache\\n    SSLEngine on\\n    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/cert.pem\\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/key.pem\\n    ```\\n\\n#### Step 5: Test the SSL Setup\\n- Use tools like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test to verify proper installation.\\n- Ensure that your site is accessible via HTTPS and that the certificate is valid.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands or Configurations Needed\\n- **Generating a CSR with OpenSSL:**\\n  ```bash\\n  openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout yourdomain.key -out yourdomain.csr\\n  ```\\n- **Installing certificates on Nginx:**\\n  ```nginx\\n  server {\\n      listen 443 ssl;\\n      server_name yourdomain.com;\\n\\n      ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;\\n      ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;\\n\\n      # Other configurations\\n  }\\n  ```\\n- **Installing certificates on Apache:**\\n  ```apache\\n  SSLEngine on\\n  SSLCertificateFile /path/to/cert.pem\\n  SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/key.pem\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:**\\n  - You must have access to your DNS records and server configurations.\\n  - Ensure your domain points to the server where the certificate will be installed.\\n- **Security Warnings:**\\n  - Never expose your private key.\\n  - Use strong encryption algorithms.\\n- **Renewals:**\\n  - SSL certificates typically expire after 90 days (Let's Encrypt) or longer (up to 2 years for paid certs). Set reminders for renewal.\\n- **Additional Context:**\\n  - Managed certificates (like AWS ACM) simplify renewal and deployment.\\n  - Proper SSL configuration is critical for security; misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nAn SSL certificate secures data transmission by encrypting traffic between clients and servers. Obtain it via a CA or managed service, install it on your server, configure your web server to use it, and verify the setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           SSL Certificate Expiring or Expired is mentioned in the context, indicating it is a certificate that may be nearing or past its expiration date, which is relevant for maintaining secure connections.      1.000000          0.797678                0.0        1.000000            0.107717                    0.0\n",

“Logging”](#logging) - [system](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/a10c2cd2b710f9eb65b13b9a2a328d51) The TraceChunks redis instances is a distinct redis cluster for storing CI build trace chunks immediately when received by the API from runners, before they are asynchronously (Ci::BuildTraceChunkFlushWorker) moved from there to ObjectStorage (as configured in .com; the database is another target option, but we don’t do that anymore). The data is important and persistent but transient (seconds to 10s of seconds normally, probably not minutes, definitely not hours, unless something has gone horribly wrong). This was split because as found in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327469#note_556531587> these trace chunks were (at the time) responsible for about 60% of the network throughput by bytes on the persistent redis, and 16% of the Redis calls, and it is a distinctive enough workload/usage pattern that splitting it out was deemed a good thing. Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters) Single threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then) The usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> ) Data is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable. Uses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover from. -]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ### 1. Direct Answer\\n**gitlab.com** is the hosted domain for GitLab's cloud-based service, providing source code management, CI/CD, and collaboration tools. It is a SaaS platform where users can host, manage, and collaborate on Git repositories without needing to run their own GitLab instance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook Context)\\nWhile the runbooks primarily focus on Gitaly and related infrastructure, understanding gitlab.com as a hosted service involves recognizing its architecture and how it integrates with Gitaly and other components.\\n\\n**To understand or troubleshoot gitlab.com in the context of GitLab's infrastructure:**\\n\\n**Step 1:** Review the architecture overview\\n- Familiarize yourself with GitLab's architecture, especially how repositories are stored and managed via Gitaly.\\n\\n**Step 2:** Check Gitaly status and health\\n- Use the Gitaly Service runbook to verify if Gitaly nodes handling gitlab.com repositories are operational.\\n- Run commands like:\\n  ```\\n  gitalyctl status\\n  ```\\n  (Refer to [Gitaly Service](/gitaly/))\\n  \\n**Step 3:** Monitor latency and performance\\n- Use the [Gitaly latency is too high] runbook to identify performance issues affecting gitlab.com repositories.\\n\\n**Step 4:** Review storage and repository health\\n- Check storage rebalancing and repository health via:\\n  - [Managing GitLab Storage Shards](/gitaly/storage-sharding/)\\n  - [Gitaly Snapshot Verification](/gitaly/snapshot-verification/)\\n\\n**Step 5:** Confirm network and routing\\n- Ensure HTTP routing and CDN configurations are correct, referencing [HTTP Router] runbooks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Check Gitaly status:**\\n  ```\\n  gitalyctl status\\n  ```\\n- **Verify repository health or corruption:**\\n  ```\\n  gitalyctl verify-repo --repo <repo_path>\\n  ```\\n- **Monitor Gitaly logs for issues:**\\n  ```\\n  journalctl -u gitaly\\n  ```\\n- **Check storage usage:**\\n  ```\\n  gitalyctl storage-info\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have access to the Gitaly infrastructure and relevant permissions.\\n- **Caution:** Do not perform any destructive operations (like repository deletion or corruption fixes) unless explicitly guided by the runbooks.\\n- **Additional Context:** Since gitlab.com is a managed SaaS, most infrastructure-level troubleshooting is handled by the GitLab Operations team. Your focus should be on monitoring, performance, and reporting issues to the appropriate team.\\n- **For user-facing issues:** Check GitLab's status page or contact support if the problem is related to the hosted service.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\ngitlab.com is GitLab's cloud-hosted platform for repositories and CI/CD. Use the runbooks related to Gitaly to monitor and troubleshoot repository storage, performance, and health, ensuring the service runs smoothly.

[Section titled “Logging”](#logging) - system The Chat Cache Redis Cluster instances is a distinct Redis Cluster used by the GitLab Rails [chat features](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410521). Redis is in a 3-node-per-shard (single-primary/two-replica per shard) VM configuration, in cluster mode. The node count will start off at 3 but will increase as we scale horizontally. Uses the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters.

Direct Answer**\\n\\nConnecting to various services via Teleport streamlines multi-service access by providing secure, unified, and auditable SSH access to infrastructure components such as PostgreSQL, Patroni clusters, and Redis. This approach simplifies management, enhances security, and enables SREs to perform troubleshooting, configuration, and operational tasks across multiple services without exposing direct network access or managing multiple SSH keys.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions**\\n\\n**Step 1: Ensure Teleport Access is Configured**\\n- Verify that your user account has the necessary roles and permissions to access the Teleport clusters hosting PostgreSQL, Patroni, Redis, and related services.\\n- Confirm your Teleport client (`tsh`) is installed and configured.\\n\\n**Step 2: Connect to the Teleport Proxy**\\n- Use `tsh` to authenticate and connect:\\n  ```\\n  tsh login --proxy=<teleport-proxy-host> --user=<your-username>\\n  ```\\n- Authenticate via MFA if required.\\n\\n**Step 3: Access PostgreSQL and Patroni Clusters**\\n- To connect to a PostgreSQL or Patroni service:\\n  ```\\n  tsh ssh <service-hostname> -l <username>\\n  ```\\n- This creates a secure SSH session through Teleport, allowing you to run commands or access databases securely.\\n\\n**Step 4: Access Redis Infrastructure**\\n- For Redis, connect via Teleport SSH to the Redis nodes or through port forwarding:\\n  ```\\n  tsh ssh <redis-node-hostname> -l <username>\\n  ```\\n- Alternatively, set up local port forwarding:\\n  ```\\n  tsh ssh -L 6379:<redis-node-hostname>:6379 <redis-node-hostname>\\n  ```\\n  Then connect locally:\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379\\n  ```\\n\\n**Step 5: Perform Management and Troubleshooting**\\n- Use the SSH sessions to run Redis CLI commands, manage Patroni/Postgres configurations, or troubleshoot issues.\\n- For Redis clusters, connect to specific nodes or use Redis Sentinel as needed.\\n\\n**Step 6: Maintain Security and Audit**\\n- All connections are logged via Teleport audit logs.\\n- Follow runbook procedures for safe configuration changes, backups, or recovery.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands**\\n\\n- **Login to Teleport:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh login --proxy=<proxy-host> --user=<your-username>\\n  ```\\n- **SSH into a service host:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh ssh <hostname>\\n  ```\\n- **Port forwarding for Redis:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh ssh -L 6379:<redis-host>:6379 <redis-host>\\n  ```\\n- **Connect to Redis CLI:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379\\n  ```\\n- **Access PostgreSQL via psql (from SSH session):**\\n  ```\\n  psql -U <user> -d <database> -h <localhost or socket>\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes**\\n\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure your user has the necessary Teleport roles and permissions.\\n- **Security:** Teleport provides a secure, audited access layer, reducing the risk of exposing direct network endpoints.\\n- **Multi-Service Access:** Teleport allows SREs to seamlessly switch between services (Postgres, Patroni, Redis) without managing multiple SSH keys or VPNs.\\n- **Operational Efficiency:** Centralized access simplifies troubleshooting, configuration, and incident response across Redis, Postgres, and Patroni clusters.\\n- **Limitations:** For high-performance Redis operations, consider local Redis clients with port forwarding; avoid long-lived SSH sessions unless necessary.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nUsing Teleport as a unified access point enables secure, auditable, and efficient management of PostgreSQL, Patroni, and Redis clusters, facilitating multi-service operations with minimal complexity.  Connecting to various services via Teleport enables secure and streamlined access to multiple infrastructure components, including PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters, by providing centralized authentication and access management. This facilitates troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintenance of these clusters within complex setups. In the context of Redis infrastructure, Teleport's ability to connect to diverse services ensures that engineers can efficiently manage Redis databases alongside PostgreSQL and Patroni, supporting high availability and performance. By enabling multi-service access through a unified platform, Teleport simplifies multi-hop workflows, allowing engineers to perform multi-layered operations—such as connecting to Redis clusters, then accessing PostgreSQL or Patroni clusters—without compromising security or efficiency.      0.000000          0.802597                1.0        1.000000            0.776789                    0.0\n",

If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n```\\n- During and after migration, Redis clients will receive `redirections` to contact the new owner of keyslots. These are not errors themselves as Redis clients would update their internal mapping of `keyslot -> master` upon receiving redirection from server. The redirections will take time to taper off and will definitely be gone after a new deployment in the environment, as all pods will be rotated in that scenario and will start off with up-to-date keyslot mapping.\\n## Key metrics to observe\\n[Section titled “Key metrics to observe”](#key-metrics-to-observe)\\nBelow is a list of some of the key metrics to check for:\\n- Redis service error ratio e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?from=now-6h&orgId=1&to=now&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=3422679610)\\n- Redis Cluster Slots Failed e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?orgId=1&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=115&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- Redirections for the clients e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?orgId=1&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=117&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis/scaling-redis-cluster.md)\\n[Previous\\nA survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab](/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres/)   [Next\\nRedis Cluster Cache Service](/redis-cluster-cache/), - (1) is FQDN of the Redis server\\n- (2) is the port number of Redis server\\n- **(3) is the node ID of the Redis instance** and required in resharding commands\\n- (4) is IP address of Redis instance\\n### 2. Calibrate the batch size for migration\\n[Section titled “2. Calibrate the batch size for migration”](#2-calibrate-the-batch-size-for-migration)\\nAt first, make a few migrations with incrementally increasing `BATCH_SIZE`, to determine a suitable size which does not cause large CPU/memory saturation spikes on the existing Redis instances and also is fast enough to complete migration within a few hours. Larger `BATCH_SIZE` will finish faster but will consume more CPU/memory due to concurrent read/writes and also compete with user requests, specially if keys have large values e.g. `set`, `list` or any other multi-value type data.\\nDuring previous migration in `redis-cluster-ratelimiting`, a `BATCH_SIZE` of 30 was used and moving 1365 keyslots took less than [5 seconds](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18061#note_1924076365).\\nVariables that need to be replaced in command below are:\\n- `FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **from** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `TO_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **to** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE`: number of keyslots to be migrated\\n- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of redis keys to be read and written from one master to another\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n# Trial runs to move some keyslots with batch size 30 to get time taken and its impact on CPU/Memory utilization\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nAt the same time, keep an eye on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. Also, note the time taken for migration of keyslots to estimate required time for completing the migration. If there is no impact on resources and time taken by migration is not reasonable, then try increasing the `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` to a workable number.\\n### 3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard\\n[Section titled “3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard”](#3-migrate-keys-from-existing-shards-to-new-shard)\\nWe have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster and a cluster with 3 shards have distribution like following:\\n1. First shard: 0-5460\\n2. Second shard: 5461-10922\\n3. Third shard: 10923-16383\\nIn this case, a new fourth shard will intake equal number of keyslots from all 3 existing shards, so 1365 keyslots from each (after round off).\\nOnce `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` have been determined, migrate the keyslots from each of existing shards to the new shard using:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nKeep a check on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```, ```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.\\n**resharding**: Migrating ownership of some hash slots from one shard to another. This is a dynamic online operation, where Redis keys are migrated between nodes. During a resharding operation, reads and writes to the keys being migrated are semantically safe but incur some extra overhead. Also, multi-key requests may temporarily fail during the transitional state. There are some documented corner cases where a failed resharding attempt must be manually completed. In our environments, because we do not intend to dynamically add/remove nodes, resharding will be a rare and planned event (e.g. when adding new nodes to the cluster for additional capacity), not a frequent automated background activity.\\nreplica migration - an optional feature that allows the cluster to dynamically reassign a replica from one master to another, to ensure all masters have at least N replicas. This feature aims to improve availability. However, it can counter-intuitively harm availability in either of 2 ways: it can lead to a master and its replicas being in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140700451)), or it can lead to accumulating a majority of masters in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140436657)). This feature can be disabled ([cluster-allow-replica-migration](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1662-L1668)) or tuned ([cluster-migration-barrier](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1642-L1660)). This is one of the topics to be addressed by scalability#2071.\\n## Observability\\n[Section titled “Observability”](#observability)\\nFor most parts, the Grafana dashboard is the same as a Sentinel-based Redis dashboard. The difference lies in:\\n1. Cluster-specific panel: This panel tracks the slot coverage and state of nodes in the cluster. The components are defined in [`libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/ff4ff9dd29ee417a4a7d1940178c3085cc25730f/libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet#L449).\\n2. `cluster_redirection` error SLI - tracks the rate of MOVED and ASK redirections. Redirections should only happen on (1) failover (requests are redirected to the new master), (2) resharding (requests are redirected to the new slot owner).\\nCross-slot errors are prevented on the application side and should not reach the servers except for pipelined operations during resharding. The volume can be tracked on logs under 2 groups of fields:\\n1. `json.redis_<functional shard>_allowed_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of

for and are running on non-cluster-based Redis)\\n2. `json.redis_<functional_shard>_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of cross-slot commands (not accounted for or running on Redis Cluster)\\n##

require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over. This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1> - Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example: Terminal window ``` $ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master 2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec') ``` #### Redis Sentinel [Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel), <2-hop>\\n\\n[Domain Registration](/uncategorized/domain-registration/) -

[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition) Redis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done. In the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well. The other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system. ## Timing [Section titled “Timing”](#timing) The last two redis partitions that we have done took between 3 - 6 weeks to complete. The main factors that slow down or speed up the time required are the availability of reviewers for MRs, particularly for the application changes. In general, tamland forecasts capacity out approximately three months, which should give us adequate time to partition if required. ## Determining what to split off [Section titled “Determining what to split off”](#determining-what-to-split-off) This is more of an art than a science, as it will require some amount of knowledge of the usage patterns of the redis in question. We have documented how to [analyze memory usage](../redis#redis-memory-analyzer) as well as [keyspace usage and network traffic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md#keyspace-pattern-analysis), all of which can be combined to help determine what the largest chunk that makes logical sense to move is. ## Implementation [Section titled “Implementation”](#implementation) A lot of these processes are still a work in progress and will be modified based off of the results of [the epic to lessen sharding toil](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/886). ## Application changes [Section titled “Application changes”](#application-changes) - Create a new redis store class. It should inherit from `Gitlab::Redis::Wrapper`. Configure its `config_fallback` to be the current store from which you’re sharding off this workload. - Add `use_primary_and_secondary_stores_for_<store_name>` and `use_primary_store_as_default_for_<store_name>` feature flags, matching the name of the new store. - Update the relevant client code to use the new store. [Example issue and MRs.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2149) ## Infrastructure changes [Section titled “Infrastructure changes”](#infrastructure-changes) With the [current k8s overhead due to the networking stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/16871), we can only migrate workloads that are expected to remain well under saturation threshold to Kubernetes. [See discussion points here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2130). This means that in most cases, we’ll likely be functionally sharding off onto VMs, but I’ve included the k8s documentation for when we can shift to using that more. We presently do not have a well known method of creating a redis cluster shard, but that is work in progress as well. ### VMs [Section titled “VMs”](#vms) 1. [Create a chef role](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/blob/master/roles/gprd-base-db-redis-server-db-load-balancing.json) 2. [Provision in terraform](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5009) 3. [Configure with redis-reconfigure.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/redis-reconfigure.sh) Step 1 and 2 will leave the cluster in a strange state, with each redis host believing they are the primary and a somewhat confused sentinel quorum. In order to get things back in order, you’ll need to run chef-client, gitlab-ctl reconfigure, and set each secondary to be a replica of the primary. The redis-reconfigure.sh script does this for you. Terminal]                                                                                                             **Direct Answer:**\\n\\nMigration procedures for Redis sharding, including cluster setup and reconfiguration, are integral to maintaining high availability and performance, especially during failover events. Properly executed resharding and reconfiguration ensure that data remains accessible, cluster state remains consistent, and client redirections are minimized. Handling failover events and master switch logs involves monitoring redirections, fixing broken cluster states, and ensuring that keyslot ownership is correctly assigned, which collectively sustain cluster resilience and efficiency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n### 1. Prepare for Migration and Monitor Cluster Health\\n- Continuously observe key metrics such as CPU/Memory saturation, Apdex violations, and redirection rates via the Redis Cluster dashboard.\\n- Detect signs of resource saturation or increased redirections indicating potential failover or reconfiguration needs.\\n\\n### 2. Initiate Resharding (Cluster Reconfiguration)\\n- Determine the number of keyslots to move and calibrate `BATCH_SIZE` by trial:\\n  - Use small batches initially (e.g., 30 keys) and increase gradually.\\n  - Run reshard commands:\\n    ```bash\\n    ssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n    sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n    ```\\n- Monitor resource impact during migration; stop (`ctrl + c`) if issues arise.\\n\\n### 3. Handle Failover Events and Master Switch Logs\\n- During failover, Redis redirects clients to the new master via `MOVED` or `ASK` redirections.\\n- Observe redirection metrics:\\n  - Use dashboards to track `cluster_redirection` errors.\\n  - Expect redirections to taper off after migration completes or environment redeployments.\\n- If cluster configuration breaks (e.g., due to process crashes or manual halts):\\n  - Run the cluster fix command:\\n    ```bash\\n    sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n    ```\\n  - This repairs broken slot mappings and resolves hanging keyslots.\\n\\n### 4. Reconfigure Cluster Post-Migration\\n- After moving keyslots, verify cluster health:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <any_node> CLUSTER NODES\\n  ```\\n- Ensure all nodes report correct slot ownership and no failed slots.\\n- Restart clients or clear their cached slot mappings if redirections persist.\\n\\n### 5. Post-Migration Validation and Monitoring\\n- Confirm no cross-slot errors or high redirection rates.\\n- Check key metrics:\\n  - Error ratios\\n  - Slot failure counts\\n  - Redirection rates\\n- Continue observing until redirection rates stabilize to zero, indicating clients have updated their mappings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Commands:**\\n- Resharding:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <SLOTS> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n  ```\\n- Fix cluster state:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n  ```\\n- Check cluster nodes:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <node_host> CLUSTER NODES\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Important Notes:**\\n- Always monitor resource utilization during migration; large batch sizes can cause CPU/memory spikes.\\n- Killing a migration process may leave keyslots in a hanging state; run `--cluster fix` to recover.\\n- Redirections are normal during resharding and failover; clients will update their mappings accordingly.\\n- Ensure cluster configuration is healthy before and after migration to prevent split-brain or data inconsistency.\\n- Regularly review logs and dashboards to detect and respond to redirection spikes or slot failures promptly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nBy carefully executing resharding procedures, monitoring redirection and failure logs, and fixing cluster states when needed, SREs can ensure Redis remains highly available and performant during topology changes and failover events. Proper handling of master switches and redirections minimizes downtime and maintains data integrity.                                                                                                                                                                   Migration procedures for Redis sharding, such as setting up clusters and reconfiguring nodes, are essential for distributing workload and achieving horizontal scaling, which directly impacts high availability and performance. Proper cluster setup ensures that Redis instances can failover seamlessly during failover events, with master switch logs providing critical information about role changes and failover occurrences. By combining effective sharding migration techniques with vigilant monitoring of master switch logs, infrastructure engineers can maintain Redis high availability, quickly respond to failover events, and optimize performance within complex infrastructure setups.      0.484848          0.837754                1.0        0.000000            0.858621                    0.0\n",

By default, we have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster. Until now, we just added Redis instances for new shard to the cluster, but they do not have any Redis keys (keyslots) yet and hence they are not serving any user requests.\\nIn this phase, we will migrate some keyslots from previous Redis shards to the new shard, so that new Redis instances start load sharing with existing Redis instances and hence lower their resource (CPU/Memory) utilization.

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots.

Here's a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how to scale up a Redis Cluster and manage nodes from 1-hop and 2-hop information themes, based on the provided runbook documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 1. Direct Answer\\nTo scale up a Redis Cluster, you need to add new nodes (shards) and redistribute hash slots (resharding) so that the load is evenly balanced across all nodes. Managing nodes involves understanding their 1-hop (directly connected nodes) and 2-hop (nodes connected via 1-hop nodes) relationships, which helps in planning resharding and failover procedures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n### **A. Prepare for Scaling Up**\\n\\n**Step 1:** Check current cluster state and node info\\n- Run `cluster_slots_fail` and `cluster_slots_pfail` to ensure no slots are failing.\\n- Verify `cluster_known_nodes` and `cluster_size` to understand current topology.\\n\\n**Step 2:** Enable debug commands (if not already enabled)\\n- Reconfigure existing nodes to enable `debug` command:\\n  ```bash\\n  # From chef-repo\\n  knife search -i \"roles:$ENV-base-db-$DEPLOYMENT\" | sort -V | grep -v $SHARD_NUMBER > /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n  # Reconfigure nodes\\n  scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n  ```\\n- *Note:* Ensure `enable-debug-command` is enabled during provisioning for new nodes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **B. Add New Nodes (Shard) to the Cluster**\\n\\n**Step 3:** Provision new Redis nodes\\n- Deploy new Redis instances with `enable-debug-command` enabled.\\n- Ensure they are reachable and configured with proper cluster settings.\\n\\n**Step 4:** Join new nodes to the cluster\\n- Use `redis-cli --cluster add-node` to add each new node:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster add-node <new-node-ip>:6379 <existing-node-ip>:6379\\n  ```\\n- Confirm the node joins successfully.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **C. Resharding (Distributing Keyslots)**\\n\\n**Step 5:** Check current keyslot assignments\\n- On a master node:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n  ```\\n- Note the slot ranges and node IDs.\\n\\n**Step 6:** Plan keyslot migration\\n- Decide how many slots to move from existing masters to new nodes to balance load.\\n\\n**Step 7:** Perform online resharding\\n- Use `redis-cli --cluster reshard`:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster reshard <any-node-ip>:6379\\n  ```\\n- Follow prompts to specify:\\n  - Number of slots to move\\n  - Source and destination nodes\\n  - Number of slots per node\\n\\n**Step 8:** Verify resharding\\n- Run `cluster slots` again to confirm even distribution.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **D. Managing 1-hop and 2-hop Info for Node Management**\\n\\n**Step 9:** Understand node relationships\\n- Use `CLUSTER NODES`:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <node-ip> CLUSTER NODES\\n  ```\\n- Identify:\\n  - **1-hop nodes:** directly connected nodes (peers)\\n  - **2-hop nodes:** nodes connected via 1-hop nodes (reachable through peers)\\n\\n**Step 10:** Use this info for failover planning\\n- When adding/removing nodes, consider their 1-hop/2-hop relationships to minimize network partitions.\\n- For example, avoid adding nodes that are 2-hop away from critical nodes unless necessary.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 3. Key Commands\\n- Check cluster slots:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n  ```\\n- Add node:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster add-node <new-node-ip>:6379 <existing-node-ip>:6379\\n  ```\\n- Reshard:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster reshard <node-ip>:6379\\n  ```\\n- View cluster nodes:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <node-ip> CLUSTER NODES\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure all nodes are configured with `enable-debug-command` if troubleshooting is needed.\\n- **Caution:** Resharding is an online operation but can impact performance; plan during maintenance windows.\\n- **Failover Consideration:** When adding/removing nodes, verify cluster health (`cluster_slots_fail`, `cluster_slots_pfail` should be 0).\\n- **Network Topology:** Use 1-hop and 2-hop info to optimize node placement and avoid network issues.\\n- **Backup:** Always backup cluster state before major resharding or scaling operations.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis structured approach ensures safe and efficient scaling of your Redis Cluster while managing node relationships effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      to scale up redis cluster and manage nodes, you need to create or recreate clusters from snapshots as described in the 1-hop context, and also perform scaling, upgrades, and maintenance activities outlined in the 2-hop context, such as geo patroni cluster management and managing redis cluster features, ensuring proper provisioning and management of redis nodes.      0.978495          0.735746                1.0        0.333333            0.248810                    0.0\n",

[primary fails (as determined by Sentinel), one of the replicas is promoted to primary.\\nClients are configured to connect to the sentinels which will then direct them to the current primary; there is no load\\nbalancer involved in this path. Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., ```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n1)  1) \"name\"\\n2) \"gstg-redis-cache\"        # cluster_id\\n3) \"ip\"\\n4) \"10.224.8.103\"            # ip address of the current master\\n5) \"port\"\\n6) \"6379\"\\n7) \"runid\"\\n8) \"06277f7abca059c268b2c5e2b2581d7d3bf330f1\"\\n9) \"flags\"\\n10) \"master\"\\n11) \"link-pending-commands\"\\n12) \"0\"\\n13) \"link-refcount\"\\n14) \"1\"\\n15) \"last-ping-sent\"\\n16) \"0\"\\n17) \"last-ok-ping-reply\"\\n18) \"440\"\\n19) \"last-ping-reply\"\\n20) \"440\"\\n21) \"down-after-milliseconds\"\\n22) \"10000\"\\n23) \"info-refresh\"\\n24) \"9021\"\\n25) \"role-reported\"\\n26) \"master\"\\n27) \"role-reported-time\"\\n28) \"956691745\"\\n29) \"config-epoch\"\\n30) \"51\"\\n31) \"num-slaves\"\\n32) \"2\"\\n33) \"num-other-sentinels\"\\n34) \"2\"\\n35) \"quorum\"\\n36) \"2\"\\n37) \"failover-timeout\"\\n38) \"60000\"\\n39) \"parallel-syncs\"\\n40) \"1\"\\n```\\n1.

[Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1) [see above](#grafana) ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1) Redis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` . It is scraped by Prometheus. See [the exporter documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) for more details. [Example `redis_exporter` metric](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=redis_commands_processed_total&g0.tab=1) in Thanos. ### redis-cli [Section titled “redis-cli”](#redis-cli) Run: - [INFO command](https://redis.io/commands/info) - [MEMORY\\_STATS command](https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats) NOTE: DO NOT USE [MONITOR] COMMAND! It streams back every command processed by the Redis server which can double the use of resources. It can overload a production machine making it unresponsive or causing an OOM kill. NOTE: DO NOT USE [KEYS] COMMAND! It will overload a production machine. ## What is causing Redis to slowdown? [Section titled “What is causing Redis to slowdown?”](#what-is-causing-redis-to-slowdown) The application relies on Redis throughput to be very high, latency spikes can be detrimental to the operation of the entire application. ### Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana”](#prometheusthanosgrafana) Explore Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana. Historical metrics might suggest a sudden change in the application behavior or traffic, for example: - operations rate, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=54> - keys rate of change, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=64> For Grafana links [see above](#grafana). ### slowlog [Section titled “slowlog”](#slowlog) The slowlog records slow Redis queries. Redis [SLOWLOG command documentation](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog). Get top 10 Redis slowlog entries: Terminal window ``` > slowlog get 10 1) 1) (integer) 5100 # A unique progressive identifier for every slow log entry. 2) (integer) 1561019091 # The unix timestamp at which the logged command was processed. 3) (integer) 21390 # The amount of time needed for its execution, in microseconds. 4) 1) \"del\" # The array composing the arguments of the command. 2) \"cache:gitlab:242234:8213877:Ci::CompareTestReportsService\" ``` To convert the timestamp, use `date -d @1561019091`. Get the command execution time threshold at which commands are logged (in microseconds): ``` > config get slowlog-log-slower-than ``` Get size of slowlog (entries are discarded like in a FIFO queue): ``` > config get slowlog-max-len ``` #### Monitoring number of slowlog entries [Section titled “Monitoring number of slowlog entries”](#monitoring-number-of-slowlog-entries) The number of entries added to the slowlog is exposed as a Prometheus metric and [there is a Grafana chart for it](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=48). #### Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog [Section titled “Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog”](#monitoring-the-rate-of-change-in-the-slowlog) A useful metric for monitoring potential slow-downs in Redis is measuring the rate of change in the `redis_slowlog_last_id`. This can be done by plotting (`changes(redis_slowlog_last_id[1h])`](../<https://prometheus.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1d&g0.expr=changes(redis_slowlog_last_id%5B1h%5D)&g0.tab=0>). ### Redis latency monitoring framework [Section titled “Redis latency monitoring framework”](#redis-latency-monitoring-framework) Redis provides a latency diagnostic tool: <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> You may need to enable it with `CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100`. From <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> : By default monitoring is disabled (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. However while the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well. #### LATENCY DOCTOR [Section titled “LATENCY DOCTOR”](#latency-doctor) Terminal window ``` > CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100 > LATENCY DOCTOR Dave, I have observed latency spikes in this Redis instance. You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave? 1. command: 5 latency spikes (average 300ms, mean deviation 120ms, period 73.40 sec). Worst all time event 500ms. I have a few advices for you: - Your current Slow Log configuration only logs events that are slower than your configured latency monitor threshold. Please use 'CONFIG, <2-hop>\\n\\npresented are an optimistic estimate, as redis will require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over. This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1> - Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example: Terminal window ``` $ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master 2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec') ``` #### Redis Sentinel [Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel)]  ### 1. Direct Answer\\nFailover and recovery procedures are essential troubleshooting tools because they help identify whether Redis slowdown or replication issues are caused by node failures, network partitions, or saturation-induced slowness. By intentionally triggering failovers or restoring nodes, SREs can observe how Redis and Sentinel behave under failure conditions, isolate the root cause of performance degradation, and verify the resilience and stability of the cluster during recovery.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### A. Diagnosing Slowdown Causes Using Failover Procedures\\n1. **Check Sentinel Status**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL masters\\n     ```\\n   - Confirm the current primary and replica states.\\n\\n2. **Identify Potential Saturation or Node Issues**\\n   - Use Redis info commands:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <redis_port> INFO\\n     ```\\n   - Look for high CPU, memory, or slow logs indicating saturation.\\n\\n3. **Trigger a Manual Failover**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n     ```\\n   - Observe how Sentinel promotes a replica to primary and how the cluster reconfigures.\\n\\n4. **Monitor the Failover Process**\\n   - Check Sentinel logs:\\n     ```\\n     tail -f /var/log/gitlab/sentinel/current\\n     ```\\n   - Watch for signs of replication lag or node re-sync issues.\\n\\n5. **Assess Post-Failover Behavior**\\n   - Verify Redis responsiveness:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <new_primary_port> PING\\n     ```\\n   - Check for continued slowdown or improved performance.\\n\\n6. **Repeat if Necessary**\\n   - If issues persist, consider simulating node failures or network partitions to observe cluster behavior.\\n\\n#### B. Recovery Procedures\\n1. **Identify Failed Nodes**\\n   - Use Sentinel info:\\n     ```\\n     SENTINEL masters\\n     ```\\n   - Confirm which nodes are down or lagging.\\n\\n2. **Reconfigure or Restart Nodes**\\n   - Restart Redis nodes:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n     ```\\n   - Or, if needed, reconfigure Redis settings (e.g., `client-output-buffer-limit`) as per troubleshooting steps.\\n\\n3. **Resynchronize Replicas**\\n   - Ensure replicas are catching up:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -p <replica_port> INFO replication\\n     ```\\n   - Confirm replication backlog and lag are within acceptable limits.\\n\\n4. **Revert any Temporary Fixes**\\n   - Reset configurations like `client-output-buffer-limit` to original values:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -p <redis_port> CONFIG SET client-output-buffer-limit \"<original_value>\"\\n     ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Check Sentinel Masters:**\\n  ```\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL masters\\n  ```\\n- **Trigger Failover:**\\n  ```\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n  ```\\n- **Check Redis Info:**\\n  ```\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <redis_port> INFO\\n  ```\\n- **Ping Redis:**\\n  ```\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <redis_port> PING\\n  ```\\n- **Adjust `client-output-buffer-limit`:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <redis_port> CONFIG SET client-output-buffer-limit \"<value>\"\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure Sentinel and Redis CLI tools are accessible and you have appropriate permissions.\\n- **Caution:** Triggering failovers can temporarily impact cluster availability; perform during maintenance windows if possible.\\n- **Monitoring:** Always monitor logs (`/var/log/gitlab/sentinel/current`) and metrics during procedures to catch issues early.\\n- **Recovery:** After troubleshooting, revert any temporary configuration changes to prevent future instability.\\n- **Cluster Variations:** Be aware of subtle configuration differences across clusters, especially between persistent and cache clusters, as noted in the documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:** Failover and recovery procedures allow SREs to simulate failure scenarios, observe cluster behavior, and isolate root causes of Redis slowdown or replication issues, thereby enabling targeted troubleshooting and ensuring cluster resilience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Failover and recovery procedures are essential for addressing redis slowdown causes and replication issues by ensuring that Redis can quickly switch to a healthy master if the current one fails, and by restoring replication links. These procedures include building new Redis servers, starting replication with 'slaveof' commands, and using Sentinel to manage automatic failover. Properly executing these steps helps maintain high availability, reduces latency spikes, and resolves replication problems, thereby improving Redis performance and stability.      1.000000          0.878541                1.0        0.333333            0.700724                    0.2\n",
