      "Query: How to monitor Redis memory usage?\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "### 1. Direct Answer\n",
      "To monitor Redis memory usage effectively, you should regularly collect memory metrics using Redis commands like `INFO MEMORY` and `MEMORY STATS`, set up Prometheus metrics if available, and watch for eviction events (`redis_evicted_keys_total`). Additionally, monitor the proportion of used memory relative to your configured maxmemory limit and alert if eviction occurs or if memory approaches the limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 1: Collect Memory Usage Data\n",
      "- Use the `INFO MEMORY` command to get an overview of current memory metrics.\n",
      "- Use the `MEMORY STATS` command for detailed memory breakdowns.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Monitor Memory Metrics Regularly\n",
      "- Schedule periodic collection of these metrics via your monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).\n",
      "- Key metrics to track:\n",
      "  - `used_memory`\n",
      "  - `used_memory_rss`\n",
      "  - `used_memory_peak`\n",
      "  - `maxmemory` (configured limit)\n",
      "  - `mem_fragmentation_ratio`\n",
      "  - `evicted_keys` (via `redis_evicted_keys_total` metric)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Set Up Alerts\n",
      "- Alert if `redis_evicted_keys_total` raises above zero, indicating missed memory saturation.\n",
      "- Alert if `used_memory` approaches the `maxmemory` limit (e.g., within 80-90%).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 4: Special Handling for Max Memory\n",
      "- Focus on the proportion of `used_memory` relative to `maxmemory`.\n",
      "- Use the `INFO MEMORY` output or Prometheus metrics to calculate this ratio.\n",
      "- Alert if the ratio exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 80%).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 5: Use Prometheus Metrics (if available)\n",
      "- If your Redis setup exports metrics to Prometheus, monitor:\n",
      "  - `redis_memory_used_bytes`\n",
      "  - `redis_memory_max_bytes`\n",
      "  - `redis_evicted_keys_total`\n",
      "- Create dashboards and alerts based on these metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Key Commands\n",
      "- **Get memory info:**\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  redis-cli INFO MEMORY\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- **Get detailed memory stats:**\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  redis-cli MEMORY STATS\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- **Check eviction count:**\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  redis-cli INFO stats\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  Look for `evicted_keys`.\n",
      "- **Configure latency monitoring (optional):**\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  redis-cli CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Important Notes\n",
      "- **Monitoring Frequency:** Regularly collect memory metrics (e.g., every minute) to detect trends.\n",
      "- **Eviction Alerts:** An increase in `evicted_keys` indicates Redis is evicting data due to memory saturation; set alerts accordingly.\n",
      "- **Maxmemory Awareness:** Focus on the ratio of used memory to `maxmemory` rather than system memory limits.\n",
      "- **Resource Impact:** Be cautious with commands like `MONITOR` or `KEYS` on production, as they can overload Redis.\n",
      "- **Additional Tools:** Use Prometheus, Grafana, or other monitoring dashboards for continuous visibility.\n",
      "- **Memory Fragmentation:** Keep an eye on `mem_fragmentation_ratio` for signs of inefficient memory use.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:** Regularly gather memory metrics via `INFO MEMORY` and `MEMORY STATS`, monitor eviction counts, and set alerts based on memory utilization thresholds and eviction events to ensure Redis memory health.\n",

Former attempts are documented here:\\n- [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256)\\n- [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358)\\n## Setting up instances\\n[Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances)\\nFirst, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely:\\n- `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd`\\n- `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1`\\n- `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag`\\n- `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`)\\n- `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag`\\n- `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`.\\n- `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\nWhen configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application.\\nE.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes.\\n**Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand.\\n### 1. Generate Redis passwords\\n[Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\nGenerate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using:\\n```\\nfor I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n```\\nUpdate both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master):\\n```\\n./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n```\\nUpdate the JSON payload to include the new instance details:\\n```\\n{\\n...,\\n\"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n\"redis_conf\": {\\n\"masteruser\": \"replica\",\\n\"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n\"user\": [\\n\"default off\",\\n\"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n\"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\",\\n\"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\",\\n\"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\"\\n]\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n```\\nDo the same for\\n```\\n./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n```\\nModify the existing JSON\\n```\\n{\\n\"redis_exporter\": {\\n\"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n\"env\": {\\n\"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\"\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n```, mv data.json.tmp data.json\\nvault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\nrm data.json\\nOR\\nglsh vault edit-secret chef env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets\\n#  Add the following object in .\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override :\\n#  \"<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>\": {\\n#    \"password\": <RAILS_REDACTED>\\n#  }\\n```\\nUpdate roles/-base.json with the relevant connection details. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3546).\\n### 2. Verification of config in a VM\\n[Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm)\\nCheck the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference.\\n```\\n[ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME>\\n=> \"PONG\"\\n[ gstg ] production>\\n```\\n### 3. Configure Gitlab Rails\\n[Section titled “3. Configure Gitlab Rails”](#3-configure-gitlab-rails)\\na. Update secret\\n```\\nvault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED>\\n```\\nFor example,\\n```\\nvault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\n======================== Secret Path ========================\\nk8s/data/env/gprd/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-rails\\n======= Metadata =======\\nKey                Value\\n---                -----\\ncreated_time       2023-03-18T00:33:29.790293426Z\\ncustom_metadata    <nil>\\ndeletion_time      n/a\\ndestroyed          false\\nversion            1\\n====== Data ======\\nKey         Value\\n---         -----\\npassword    <RAILS_REDACTED>\\n```\\nNote the version of the password in `vault kv get` and make sure it tallies with the external secret definition in [k8s-workload](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/master/releases/gitlab-external-secrets/values/values.yaml.gotmpl):\\n```\\ngitlab-redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails-credential-v1:\\nrefreshInterval: 0\\nsecretStoreName: gitlab-secrets\\ntarget:\\ncreationPolicy: Owner\\ndeletionPolicy: Delete\\ndata:\\n- remoteRef:\\nkey: env/{{ $env }}/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\nproperty: password\\nversion: \"1\"\\nsecretKey: password\\n```\\nNote that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets).\\nb. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly.\\nEither add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2753).\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n#### No metrics on dashboard\\n[Section titled “No metrics on dashboard”](#no-metrics-on-dashboard), ```\\nUse the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..m}` where `n` is the number of shards and `m` is the number of instances per shard.\\n```\\nfor i in {01,02,03}-{02,03}; do\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\\\n$DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\\\n$DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379\\nsleep 2\\ndone\\n```\\nUse the following command, to assign the replicas within each shard.

Former attempts are documented here: - [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256) - [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358) ## Setting up instances [Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances) First, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely: - `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd` - `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1` - `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag` - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`) - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag` - `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`. - `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) When configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application. E.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes. **Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand. ### 1. Generate Redis passwords [Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords) Generate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using: ``` for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done ``` Update both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master): ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV> ``` Update the JSON payload to include the new instance details: ``` { ..., \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"redis_conf\": { \"masteruser\": \"replica\", \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"user\": [ \"default off\", \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\", \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\", \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\" ] } } } ``` Do the same for ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV> ``` Modify the existing JSON ``` { \"redis_exporter\": { \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"env\": { \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\" } } } } ``` ### 2. Create Chef roles [Section titled “2. Create Chef roles”](#2-create-chef-roles) Set the new chef roles and add the new role to the list of gitlab-redis roles in -infra-prometheus-server role. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3494). ### 3. Provision VMs [Section titled “3. Provision VMs”](#3-provision-vms) Provision the VMs via the generic-stor/google terraform module. This is done in the [config-mgmt project in the ops environment](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/). An example MR can be found [here](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5811). After the MR is merged and applied, check the VM state via: ``` gcloud compute instances list --project <GCP_PROJECT> | grep 'redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>' ``` You need to wait for the initial chef-client run to complete. One way to check is to tail the serial port output to check when the initial run is completed. An example: ``` gcloud compute --project=<GCP_PROJECT> instances tail-serial-port-output redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV> --zone us-east1-{c/b/d} ``` ### 4. Initialising the cluster [Section titled “4. Initialising the cluster”](#4-initialising-the-cluster) a. SSH into one of the instance: ``` ssh redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV>.c.<GCP_PROJECT>.internal ``` b. Run the following: ``` export ENV=<ENV> export PROJECT=<GCP_PROJECT> export DEPLOYMENT=redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE> ``` c. Use the following command to connect the master-nodes and initialise a working cluster. Add more shard FQDN where necessary. e.g. `$DEPLOYMENT-shard-<shard_number>-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379`. ``` sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster create \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-02-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-03-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 ``` Use the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..m}` where `n` is the number of shards and `m` is the number of instances per shard. ``` for i in {01,02,03}-{02,03}; do sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 sleep 2 done ``` Use the following command, to assign the replicas within each shard. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..n}` where necessary depending on the cluster-size. ``` for i in {01,02,03}; do for j in {02,03}; do node_id=\"$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster nodes | grep $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal | awk '{ print $1 }')\"; sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-$j-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal \\ cluster replicate $node_id done done ``` ### 5. Validation [Section titled “5. Validation”](#5-validation) Wait for a few seconds as the nodes need time to gossip. Check the status via: ``` $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal:6379 (9b0828e3...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.3:6379 (ac03fcee...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.4:6379 (f8341afd...) -> 0 keys | 5462 slots | 2 slaves. [OK] 0 keys in 3 masters. 0.00 keys per slot on average. $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster info | head -n7 cluster_state:ok cluster_slots_assigned:16384 cluster_slots_ok:16384 cluster_slots_pfail:0 cluster_slots_fail:0 cluster_known_nodes:9 cluster_size:3 ``` ## Configuring the applications [Section titled “Configuring the applications”](#configuring-the-applications) ### 1. Configure console instances [Section titled “1. Configure console instances”](#1-configure-console-instances) a. Proxy and authenticate to Hashicorp Vault: ``` glsh vault proxy export VAULT_PROXY_ADDR=\"socks5://localhost:18200\" glsh vault login ``` ``` vault kv get -format=json chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets | jq '.data.data' > data.json cat data.json | jq --arg PASSWORD <RAILS_REDACTED> '.\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>.password = $PASSWORD' > data.json.tmp diff -u data.json data.json.tmp mv data.json.tmp data.json vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json rm data.json OR glsh vault edit-secret chef env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets # Add the following object in .\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override : # \"<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>\": { # \"password\": <RAILS_REDACTED> # } ``` Update roles/-base.json with the relevant connection details. An example MR can]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ### 1. Direct Answer\\nHashicorp Vault is used to securely store, manage, and rotate Redis cluster passwords. It acts as a centralized secrets management system, ensuring that Redis credentials are kept confidential, versioned, and easily retrievable by authorized systems, such as GitLab Rails, application components, and automation scripts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### a. Generate Redis Passwords\\n1. Generate four secure passwords:\\n   ```bash\\n   for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n   ```\\n2. Store these passwords securely for use in Vault updates.\\n\\n#### b. Update Vault Secrets for Redis Cluster and Exporter\\n3. Use `gkms-vault-edit` to update the secrets:\\n   ```bash\\n   ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n   ```\\n4. Modify the JSON payload to include the new passwords and configuration:\\n   ```json\\n   {\\n     \"...\": \"...\",\\n     \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n       \"redis_conf\": {\\n         \"masteruser\": \"replica\",\\n         \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n         \"user\": [\\n           \"default off\",\\n           \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n           \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\",\\n           \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\",\\n           \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\"\\n         ]\\n       }\\n     }\\n   }\\n   ```\\n5. Similarly, update the exporter secret:\\n   ```json\\n   {\\n     \"redis_exporter\": {\\n       \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n         \"env\": {\\n           \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\"\\n         }\\n       }\\n     }\\n   }\\n   ```\\n6. Save and patch the secret:\\n   ```bash\\n   mv data.json.tmp data.json\\n   vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n   rm data.json\\n   ```\\n   Or use:\\n   ```bash\\n   glsh vault edit-secret chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets\\n   ```\\n\\n#### c. Store Secrets in Kubernetes\\n7. Retrieve the secret version:\\n   ```bash\\n   vault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\n   ```\\n8. Ensure the secret version matches the external secret configuration, and update the `.Values.global.redis` configuration accordingly.\\n\\n#### d. Configure Application to Use Vault Secrets\\n9. Use `vault kv put` to set the Redis password in the application's secret store:\\n   ```bash\\n   vault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED>\\n   ```\\n10. Update the application's configuration files (e.g., `gitlab.rb`, Helm values) to reference the stored secret.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- Generate passwords:\\n  ```bash\\n  for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n  ```\\n- Update Vault secrets:\\n  ```bash\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n  ```\\n- Patch secrets:\\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n  ```\\n- Retrieve secrets:\\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\n  ```\\n- Store secrets in Kubernetes:\\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED>\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Security:** Always handle passwords and secrets with care; avoid exposing them in logs or insecure locations.\\n- **Versioning:** Vault maintains versions of secrets; ensure the correct version is referenced in your application configuration.\\n- **Rotation:** Follow the documented procedures for secret rotation to prevent service disruptions.\\n- **Access Control:** Only authorized automation and personnel should have access to Vault secrets.\\n- **Consistency:** Ensure that the secrets stored in Vault are synchronized with application configurations to prevent mismatches.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis process ensures Redis passwords are securely managed, rotated, and accessible only to authorized systems, leveraging Hashicorp Vault as a central secrets management solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hashicorp Vault is used to generate and store Redis passwords, which are then updated in the vault secrets and used for configuring Redis cluster instances and related services.      1.000000          0.975658                1.0        1.000000            0.284395                    0.2\n",

It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability). It’s not a full DBMS with\\nguaranteed write semantics (and performance implications to match), but it is sufficiently persistent that there wouldn’t, Note that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets).\\nb. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly.\\nEither add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`.

Verification of config in a VM [Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm) Check the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference. ``` [ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME> => \"PONG\" [ gstg ] production> ``` ### 3.

Direct Answer\\nNo, GitLab is not used for managing Redis configurations directly in the infrastructure setup. Redis configurations are managed through configuration files (e.g., `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf`) and controlled via GitLab's Omnibus `gitlab-ctl` commands, but GitLab itself does not serve as a configuration management tool for Redis. Instead, Redis is configured via configuration files, environment variables, and runbook procedures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n**To manage Redis configurations or troubleshoot Redis at GitLab:**\\n\\n**A. Checking Current Redis Configuration**\\n1. Access the Redis configuration file:\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo cat /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf\\n   ```\\n2. To retrieve specific parameters (e.g., `client-output-buffer-limit`), use:\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo grep 'client-output-buffer-limit' /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf\\n   ```\\n\\n**B. Applying Configuration Changes**\\n1. Convert any non-bytes values to bytes as per the runbook (e.g., 4GB = 4294967296).\\n2. Use `redis-cli` to set runtime configurations:\\n   ```bash\\n   REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n   /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set client-output-buffer-limit \"slave 4294967296 4294967296 0\"\\n   ```\\n3. Note: For persistent changes, modify the `redis.conf` file directly and then restart Redis.\\n\\n**C. Restarting Redis if Needed**\\n- To restart Redis after configuration changes:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n  ```\\n\\n**D. Troubleshooting Redis**\\n- If Redis is down:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl start redis\\n  ```\\n- To check logs:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo less /var/log/gitlab/redis/current\\n  ```\\n- For metrics collection issues, verify logs for `MASTER <-> SLAVE sync` events or restart services as needed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- To set a configuration at runtime:\\n  ```bash\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set <parameter> \"<value>\"\\n  ```\\n- To restart Redis:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n  ```\\n- To check Redis logs:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo less /var/log/gitlab/redis/current\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- Redis configurations are primarily managed via configuration files and controlled through `gitlab-ctl`.\\n- Always convert human-readable sizes (e.g., GB) into bytes before applying settings.\\n- Changes to `redis.conf` require a restart of Redis to take effect.\\n- Do not modify Redis configurations directly via `redis-cli` for persistent settings unless intended for runtime adjustments only.\\n- Use the runbook procedures for troubleshooting, especially when Redis metrics are unavailable or Redis is down.\\n- GitLab's runbook emphasizes careful handling of configuration changes and restart procedures; avoid manual edits without proper validation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nGitLab does not serve as a management platform for Redis configurations. Instead, Redis is configured via configuration files and controlled through `gitlab-ctl` commands, with procedures outlined in the runbook for safe management and troubleshooting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The context mentions GitLab in relation to verifying configuration in a VM, updating secrets, and configuring GitLab Rails, indicating that GitLab is used for managing redis configurations within the infrastructure setup.      0.822222          0.930928                1.0        1.000000            0.270775                    0.0\n",

                                 ### 1. Direct Answer\\nAn SSL Certificate (Secure Sockets Layer Certificate) is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and enables encrypted communication between the server and clients. It ensures data privacy, integrity, and security during data transmission over the internet.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook Procedures)\\n\\n**Note:** The runbook documentation provided does not explicitly detail SSL certificate procedures, but generally, the process involves obtaining, installing, and configuring certificates for secure communication.\\n\\n**General Procedure:**\\n\\n1. **Identify the Need for an SSL Certificate**\\n   - Determine which domain or service requires SSL encryption.\\n   \\n2. **Choose the Type of Certificate**\\n   - Decide between options such as AWS Managed Certificates, self-signed, or third-party certificates.\\n   - For example, see [AWS Managed Certificates](https://about.gitlab.com/certificates/aws/) for cloud-managed options.\\n\\n3. **Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**\\n   - Use OpenSSL or your server's tools to generate a CSR.\\n   - Example command:\\n     ```bash\\n     openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout yourdomain.key -out yourdomain.csr\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Submit CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA)**\\n   - Send the CSR to your chosen CA (e.g., Let's Encrypt, DigiCert).\\n   - Follow their process to validate domain ownership.\\n\\n5. **Receive and Download the Certificate**\\n   - Once validated, download the issued certificate files (certificate, CA bundle).\\n\\n6. **Install the Certificate on Your Server**\\n   - Place the certificate files in the appropriate directory.\\n   - Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to use the SSL certificate.\\n   - Example for Nginx:\\n     ```nginx\\n     server {\\n       listen 443 ssl;\\n       server_name yourdomain.com;\\n\\n       ssl_certificate /path/to/yourdomain.crt;\\n       ssl_certificate_key /path/to/yourdomain.key;\\n\\n       # other configurations\\n     }\\n     ```\\n\\n7. **Configure Automatic Renewal (if applicable)**\\n   - For Let's Encrypt, set up Certbot or similar tools to auto-renew.\\n\\n8. **Verify the SSL Installation**\\n   - Use online tools like SSL Labs or run:\\n     ```bash\\n     openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443\\n     ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands or Configurations Needed\\n- **Generate CSR and private key:**\\n  ```bash\\n  openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout yourdomain.key -out yourdomain.csr\\n  ```\\n- **Install certificate files on your server:**\\n  - For Nginx:\\n    ```nginx\\n    ssl_certificate /path/to/yourdomain.crt;\\n    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/yourdomain.key;\\n    ```\\n  - For Apache:\\n    ```apache\\n    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/yourdomain.crt\\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/yourdomain.key\\n    ```\\n\\n- **Renewal commands (for Let's Encrypt with Certbot):**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo certbot renew\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have access to your server's configuration files and permissions to install certificates.\\n- **Security:** Never expose your private key. Store it securely.\\n- **Validation:** Proper domain validation is crucial for certificate issuance.\\n- **Compatibility:** Confirm your server software supports SSL/TLS protocols.\\n- **Compliance:** Use certificates that meet your organization's security standards and compliance requirements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nAn SSL certificate is essential for securing data in transit. The process involves generating a CSR, obtaining a certificate from a CA, installing it on your server, and configuring your web service to use SSL. Proper management and renewal are vital to maintain secure communications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           SSL Certificate Expiring or Expired is mentioned in the context, indicating it is a certificate that may be nearing or past its expiration date, which is relevant for maintaining secure connections.      1.000000          0.821963                0.0        0.000000            0.105327                    0.0\n",

“Logging”](#logging) - [system](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/a10c2cd2b710f9eb65b13b9a2a328d51) The TraceChunks redis instances is a distinct redis cluster for storing CI build trace chunks immediately when received by the API from runners, before they are asynchronously (Ci::BuildTraceChunkFlushWorker) moved from there to ObjectStorage (as configured in .com; the database is another target option, but we don’t do that anymore). The data is important and persistent but transient (seconds to 10s of seconds normally, probably not minutes, definitely not hours, unless something has gone horribly wrong). This was split because as found in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327469#note_556531587> these trace chunks were (at the time) responsible for about 60% of the network throughput by bytes on the persistent redis, and 16% of the Redis calls, and it is a distinctive enough workload/usage pattern that splitting it out was deemed a good thing. Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters) Single threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then) The usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> ) Data is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable. Uses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover from. -]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ### 1. Direct Answer\\n**gitlab.com** is the hosted domain for GitLab's cloud-based service, providing source code management, CI/CD, and collaboration tools. It is the public instance of GitLab where users can host repositories, run CI pipelines, and manage projects without self-hosting.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook Context)\\nWhile the runbooks primarily focus on Gitaly and related internal procedures, understanding gitlab.com as a hosted service involves the following general steps:\\n\\n**a. Accessing GitLab.com**\\n- Visit [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) in your web browser.\\n- Log in with your credentials or create an account if needed.\\n\\n**b. Managing Repositories**\\n- Create, clone, or push repositories via the web interface or Git commands.\\n- Use the GitLab UI for project management, CI/CD pipelines, and collaboration.\\n\\n**c. Internal Infrastructure (for SREs)**\\n- For internal troubleshooting or maintenance, refer to runbooks related to Gitaly, storage, and service health.\\n- Use internal tools and commands (e.g., `gitalyctl`, Gitaly logs) to monitor and troubleshoot the backend services supporting gitlab.com.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands or Configurations\\n- **Accessing Gitaly services (for internal troubleshooting):**\\n  ```bash\\n  gitalyctl status\\n  ```\\n- **Checking Gitaly logs:**\\n  ```bash\\n  journalctl -u gitaly\\n  ```\\n- **Restarting Gitaly (if needed):**\\n  ```bash\\n  systemctl restart gitaly\\n  ```\\n- **Monitoring Gitaly performance:**\\n  - Use profiling tools or runbook procedures outlined in [Gitaly profiling](/gitaly/gitaly-profiling/).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Public Access:** gitlab.com is a managed SaaS platform; internal runbooks are primarily for internal Gitaly and infrastructure management.\\n- **For Users:** No internal commands are needed; simply access via the web or Git clients.\\n- **For SREs:** Ensure you have proper access rights and follow internal procedures for troubleshooting or maintenance.\\n- **Prerequisites:** Internal procedures require appropriate permissions and understanding of Gitaly and GitLab architecture.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\ngitlab.com is the cloud-hosted GitLab service for source code management and CI/CD. Internal runbooks provide detailed procedures for maintaining the underlying infrastructure, especially Gitaly, which handles repository storage and access.

[Section titled “Logging”](#logging) - system The Chat Cache Redis Cluster instances is a distinct Redis Cluster used by the GitLab Rails [chat features](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410521). Redis is in a 3-node-per-shard (single-primary/two-replica per shard) VM configuration, in cluster mode. The node count will start off at 3 but will increase as we scale horizontally. Uses the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters.

Direct Answer\\nConnecting to various services via Teleport streamlines multi-service access by providing secure, unified, and auditable SSH access to infrastructure components such as PostgreSQL, Patroni clusters, Redis, and related services. This approach simplifies management, enhances security, and enables SREs to perform operations across multiple services without managing individual SSH keys or network configurations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### A. Set Up Teleport Access\\n1. **Ensure Teleport is configured and accessible** for your user account with appropriate roles.\\n2. **Authenticate via Teleport**:\\n   ```bash\\n   tsh login --proxy=<teleport-proxy-host>\\n   ```\\n3. **Verify your access**:\\n   ```bash\\n   tsh status\\n   ```\\n\\n#### B. Connect to PostgreSQL and Patroni Clusters\\n4. **Identify the service hostname or node** from the runbook documentation (e.g., Patroni registry or Sec services).\\n5. **Establish an SSH session via Teleport**:\\n   ```bash\\n   tsh ssh <service-hostname>\\n   ```\\n6. **Access the PostgreSQL or Patroni environment**:\\n   - For PostgreSQL, use `psql` or relevant admin tools.\\n   - For Patroni, connect to the Patroni API or use `patroni` CLI if available.\\n\\n#### C. Connect to Redis Infrastructure\\n7. **Identify Redis service endpoints** from the documentation (e.g., `/redis/`).\\n8. **Connect via Teleport SSH or use Redis CLI**:\\n   ```bash\\n   tsh ssh <redis-node-hostname>\\n   redis-cli -h <redis-hostname> -p <port>\\n   ```\\n   - Alternatively, if Redis is exposed via a proxy or load balancer, connect directly to that endpoint.\\n\\n#### D. Multi-Service Access\\n9. **Use Teleport's session recording and audit logs** for compliance and troubleshooting.\\n10. **Switch between services seamlessly** by opening multiple SSH sessions or multiplexing within Teleport.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Login to Teleport**:\\n  ```bash\\n  tsh login --proxy=<proxy-host>\\n  ```\\n- **SSH into a service node**:\\n  ```bash\\n  tsh ssh <node-hostname>\\n  ```\\n- **Access PostgreSQL**:\\n  ```bash\\n  psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <database>\\n  ```\\n- **Access Redis**:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -h <redis-host> -p <port>\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites**:\\n  - Ensure your user has the necessary Teleport roles and permissions.\\n  - Confirm network policies allow SSH access via Teleport.\\n- **Security**:\\n  - Teleport provides secure, encrypted tunnels, reducing exposure.\\n  - Use `tsh` for authentication and session management.\\n- **Multi-Service Context**:\\n  - Teleport simplifies multi-service workflows by centralizing access, reducing the need for multiple VPNs or SSH keys.\\n  - It also enables audit logging, which is critical for compliance and troubleshooting.\\n- **Redis Management**:\\n  - Connecting via Teleport to Redis nodes allows SREs to perform operations like configuration checks, memory analysis, or cluster management securely.\\n- **Integration with Runbooks**:\\n  - Follow specific runbook procedures for each service once connected, e.g., provisioning Redis clusters, managing Patroni, or troubleshooting PostgreSQL.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nUsing Teleport to connect to various services provides a secure, unified, and auditable way for SREs to manage PostgreSQL, Patroni, Redis, and other infrastructure components efficiently, especially in a multi-service environment.  Connecting to various services via Teleport enables secure and streamlined access to multiple infrastructure components, including PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters, by providing centralized authentication and access management. This facilitates troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintenance of these clusters within complex setups. In the context of Redis infrastructure, Teleport's ability to connect to diverse services ensures that engineers can efficiently manage Redis databases alongside PostgreSQL and Patroni, supporting high availability and performance. By enabling multi-service access through a unified platform, Teleport simplifies multi-hop workflows, allowing engineers to perform multi-layered operations—such as connecting to Redis clusters, then accessing PostgreSQL or Patroni clusters—without compromising security or efficiency.      0.138889          0.839843                1.0        1.000000            0.404125                    0.0\n",

If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n```\\n- During and after migration, Redis clients will receive `redirections` to contact the new owner of keyslots. These are not errors themselves as Redis clients would update their internal mapping of `keyslot -> master` upon receiving redirection from server. The redirections will take time to taper off and will definitely be gone after a new deployment in the environment, as all pods will be rotated in that scenario and will start off with up-to-date keyslot mapping.\\n## Key metrics to observe\\n[Section titled “Key metrics to observe”](#key-metrics-to-observe)\\nBelow is a list of some of the key metrics to check for:\\n- Redis service error ratio e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?from=now-6h&orgId=1&to=now&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=3422679610)\\n- Redis Cluster Slots Failed e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?orgId=1&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=115&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- Redirections for the clients e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?orgId=1&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=117&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis/scaling-redis-cluster.md)\\n[Previous\\nA survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab](/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres/)   [Next\\nRedis Cluster Cache Service](/redis-cluster-cache/), - (1) is FQDN of the Redis server\\n- (2) is the port number of Redis server\\n- **(3) is the node ID of the Redis instance** and required in resharding commands\\n- (4) is IP address of Redis instance\\n### 2. Calibrate the batch size for migration\\n[Section titled “2. Calibrate the batch size for migration”](#2-calibrate-the-batch-size-for-migration)\\nAt first, make a few migrations with incrementally increasing `BATCH_SIZE`, to determine a suitable size which does not cause large CPU/memory saturation spikes on the existing Redis instances and also is fast enough to complete migration within a few hours. Larger `BATCH_SIZE` will finish faster but will consume more CPU/memory due to concurrent read/writes and also compete with user requests, specially if keys have large values e.g. `set`, `list` or any other multi-value type data.\\nDuring previous migration in `redis-cluster-ratelimiting`, a `BATCH_SIZE` of 30 was used and moving 1365 keyslots took less than [5 seconds](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18061#note_1924076365).\\nVariables that need to be replaced in command below are:\\n- `FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **from** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `TO_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **to** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE`: number of keyslots to be migrated\\n- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of redis keys to be read and written from one master to another\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n# Trial runs to move some keyslots with batch size 30 to get time taken and its impact on CPU/Memory utilization\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nAt the same time, keep an eye on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. Also, note the time taken for migration of keyslots to estimate required time for completing the migration. If there is no impact on resources and time taken by migration is not reasonable, then try increasing the `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` to a workable number.\\n### 3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard\\n[Section titled “3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard”](#3-migrate-keys-from-existing-shards-to-new-shard)\\nWe have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster and a cluster with 3 shards have distribution like following:\\n1. First shard: 0-5460\\n2. Second shard: 5461-10922\\n3. Third shard: 10923-16383\\nIn this case, a new fourth shard will intake equal number of keyslots from all 3 existing shards, so 1365 keyslots from each (after round off).\\nOnce `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` have been determined, migrate the keyslots from each of existing shards to the new shard using:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nKeep a check on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```, ```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.\\n**resharding**: Migrating ownership of some hash slots from one shard to another. This is a dynamic online operation, where Redis keys are migrated between nodes. During a resharding operation, reads and writes to the keys being migrated are semantically safe but incur some extra overhead. Also, multi-key requests may temporarily fail during the transitional state. There are some documented corner cases where a failed resharding attempt must be manually completed. In our environments, because we do not intend to dynamically add/remove nodes, resharding will be a rare and planned event (e.g. when adding new nodes to the cluster for additional capacity), not a frequent automated background activity.\\nreplica migration - an optional feature that allows the cluster to dynamically reassign a replica from one master to another, to ensure all masters have at least N replicas. This feature aims to improve availability. However, it can counter-intuitively harm availability in either of 2 ways: it can lead to a master and its replicas being in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140700451)), or it can lead to accumulating a majority of masters in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140436657)). This feature can be disabled ([cluster-allow-replica-migration](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1662-L1668)) or tuned ([cluster-migration-barrier](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1642-L1660)). This is one of the topics to be addressed by scalability#2071.\\n## Observability\\n[Section titled “Observability”](#observability)\\nFor most parts, the Grafana dashboard is the same as a Sentinel-based Redis dashboard. The difference lies in:\\n1. Cluster-specific panel: This panel tracks the slot coverage and state of nodes in the cluster. The components are defined in [`libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/ff4ff9dd29ee417a4a7d1940178c3085cc25730f/libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet#L449).\\n2. `cluster_redirection` error SLI - tracks the rate of MOVED and ASK redirections. Redirections should only happen on (1) failover (requests are redirected to the new master), (2) resharding (requests are redirected to the new slot owner).\\nCross-slot errors are prevented on the application side and should not reach the servers except for pipelined operations during resharding. The volume can be tracked on logs under 2 groups of fields:\\n1. `json.redis_<functional shard>_allowed_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of [allowed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/92312944bb8a827b5d00509a5d07d0fe8ee4955d/lib/gitlab/instrumentation/redis_cluster_validator.rb#L205) cross-slot calls (i.e. commands are accounted for and are running on non-cluster-based Redis)\\n2. `json.redis_<functional_shard>_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of cross-slot commands (not accounted for or running on Redis Cluster)\\n##

require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over.

[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition) Redis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done. In the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well. The other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system. ## Timing [Section titled “Timing”](#timing) The last two redis partitions that we have done took between 3 - 6 weeks to complete. The main factors that slow down or speed up the time required are the availability of reviewers for MRs, particularly for the application changes. In general, tamland forecasts capacity out approximately three months, which should give us adequate time to partition if required. ## Determining what to split off [Section titled “Determining what to split off”](#determining-what-to-split-off) This is more of an art than a science, as it will require some amount of knowledge of the usage patterns of the redis in question. We have documented how to [analyze memory usage](../redis#redis-memory-analyzer) as well as [keyspace usage and network traffic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md#keyspace-pattern-analysis), all of which can be combined to help determine what the largest chunk that makes logical sense to move is. ## Implementation [Section titled “Implementation”](#implementation) A lot of these processes are still a work in progress and will be modified based off of the results of [the epic to lessen sharding toil](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/886). ## Application changes [Section titled “Application changes”](#application-changes) - Create a new redis store class. It should inherit from `Gitlab::Redis::Wrapper`. Configure its `config_fallback` to be the current store from which you’re sharding off this workload. - Add `use_primary_and_secondary_stores_for_<store_name>` and `use_primary_store_as_default_for_<store_name>` feature flags, matching the name of the new store. - Update the relevant client code to use the new store. [Example issue and MRs.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2149) ## Infrastructure changes [Section titled “Infrastructure changes”](#infrastructure-changes) With the [current k8s overhead due to the networking stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/16871), we can only migrate workloads that are expected to remain well under saturation threshold to Kubernetes. [See discussion points here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2130). This means that in most cases, we’ll likely be functionally sharding off onto VMs, but I’ve included the k8s documentation for when we can shift to using that more. We presently do not have a well known method of creating a redis cluster shard, but that is work in progress as well. ### VMs [Section titled “VMs”](#vms) 1.

[Configure with redis-reconfigure.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/redis-reconfigure.sh) Step 1 and 2 will leave the cluster in a strange state, with each redis host believing they are the primary and a somewhat confused sentinel quorum. In order to get things back in order, you’ll need to run chef-client, gitlab-ctl reconfigure, and set each secondary to be a replica of the primary. The redis-reconfigure.sh script does this for you.

Proper migration ensures that hash slot ownership is correctly transferred, minimizing data inconsistency and downtime during failovers. Monitoring master switch logs and redirection metrics helps detect and respond to failover events, ensuring high availability and optimal performance. Effective resharding and fix procedures maintain cluster integrity, especially after failovers or configuration disruptions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n### 1. Prepare for Migration and Monitor Cluster Health\\n- Continuously observe key metrics:\\n  - CPU/Memory saturation\\n  - Apdex violations\\n  - Cluster Slots Failed\\n  - Redirection rates (`MOVED`/`ASK`)\\n- Use the Redis Cluster dashboard links provided to track these metrics.\\n- If signs of instability or high redirection rates appear, consider halting migration (`ctrl + c`) to prevent further issues.\\n\\n### 2. Initiate Resharding with Awareness of Failover Events\\n- When adding or rebalancing shards:\\n  - Use the `gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard` command with appropriate parameters.\\n  - Migrate keyslots gradually, monitoring resource impact.\\n- During migration:\\n  - Redis clients will receive redirection responses (`MOVED`, `ASK`) indicating hash slot ownership changes.\\n  - These redirections are normal during resharding or failover events and should taper off once migration completes.\\n\\n### 3. Handle Failover Events and Master Switches\\n- Failover events (triggered by Redis Sentinel or cluster health checks) cause master switches.\\n- After a failover:\\n  - The cluster updates hash slot ownership.\\n  - Clients receive redirection responses until their internal slot cache updates.\\n- To ensure consistency:\\n  - Run `--cluster fix` if cluster configuration becomes broken (e.g., after manual halts or process failures).\\n  - Use the command:\\n    ```\\n    ssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n    sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n    ```\\n- Check logs for master switch events to verify that failovers are handled correctly.\\n\\n### 4. Post-Failover and Migration Fixes\\n- If a migration is interrupted or the cluster state is inconsistent:\\n  - Run the fix command above.\\n  - Confirm that all keyslots are correctly assigned and no hanging keyslots remain.\\n- After fixing:\\n  - Restart clients or clear their cache to update slot mappings.\\n  - Monitor redirection metrics to ensure redirections decrease to normal levels.\\n\\n### 5. Reconfigure and Rebalance as Needed\\n- When adding new nodes:\\n  - Distribute keyslots evenly.\\n  - Use `reshard` commands with calibrated `BATCH_SIZE` to minimize resource impact.\\n- During reconfiguration:\\n  - Watch for increased redirections or errors.\\n  - Address any broken cluster state promptly with `--cluster fix`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Commands:**\\n\\n- **Resharding:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <SLOTS> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Fix Cluster State:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Check Cluster State:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -c -h <host> -p <port> CLUSTER NODES\\n  redis-cli -c -h <host> -p <port> CLUSTER SLOTS\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Important Notes:**\\n\\n- Always monitor redirection metrics; high redirection rates indicate ongoing resharding or failover adjustments.\\n- Killing a migration process can leave keyslots in a hanging state; always run `--cluster fix` afterward.\\n- Failover events are logged as master switches; ensure your monitoring captures these logs to verify cluster health.\\n- Properly calibrate `BATCH_SIZE` during migration to balance speed and resource consumption.\\n- During failovers, clients will experience redirections; ensure clients are configured to handle these gracefully.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nMigration procedures are integral to maintaining cluster health during failovers. By carefully managing resharding, monitoring master switch logs, and fixing cluster state when needed, SREs can ensure Redis remains highly available and performs optimally even during topology changes or failures.                                                                                                                                                                   Migration procedures for Redis sharding, such as setting up clusters and reconfiguring nodes, are essential for distributing workload and achieving horizontal scaling, which directly impacts high availability and performance. Proper cluster setup ensures that Redis instances can failover seamlessly during failover events, with master switch logs providing critical information about role changes and failover occurrences. By combining effective sharding migration techniques with vigilant monitoring of master switch logs, infrastructure engineers can maintain Redis high availability, quickly respond to failover events, and optimize performance within complex infrastructure setups.      0.380952          0.861277                1.0        0.000000            0.338494                    0.0\n",

By default, we have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster. Until now, we just added Redis instances for new shard to the cluster, but they do not have any Redis keys (keyslots) yet and hence they are not serving any user requests.\\nIn this phase, we will migrate some keyslots from previous Redis shards to the new shard, so that new Redis instances start load sharing with existing Redis instances and hence lower their resource (CPU/Memory) utilization.

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n# Redis Cluster\\n## Core concepts\\n[Section titled “Core concepts”](#core-concepts)\\nRedis Cluster is a mode of Redis to enable horizontal scaling.

Here's a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how to scale up a Redis Cluster and manage nodes from 1-hop and 2-hop information themes, based on the provided runbook documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 1. Direct Answer\\nTo scale up a Redis Cluster, you need to add new nodes (shards) and redistribute keyslots (resharding) so that the load is balanced across all nodes. Managing nodes involves understanding cluster topology via 1-hop (directly connected nodes) and 2-hop (nodes connected through a peer) information, ensuring cluster health, and performing resharding safely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n## A. Prepare for Scaling\\n1. **Check Cluster State**\\n   - Verify cluster health:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -c -h <existing-node-host> cluster info\\n     ```\\n     Ensure `cluster_slots_pfail:0` and `cluster_slots_fail:0` indicating no failed slots.\\n\\n2. **Identify Current Nodes and Slots**\\n   - List current nodes:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -c -h <existing-node-host> cluster nodes\\n     ```\\n   - Check current keyslot distribution:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -c -h <existing-node-host> cluster slots\\n     ```\\n\\n## B. Add New Nodes (Scaling Out)\\n3. **Provision New Redis Nodes**\\n   - Set up new Redis instances with `cluster-enabled yes`.\\n   - During provisioning, ensure `enable-debug-command` is enabled if troubleshooting is needed later.\\n\\n4. **Join New Nodes to the Cluster**\\n   - Use `redis-cli --cluster add-node`:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli --cluster add-node <new-node-host>:6379 <existing-node-host>:6379\\n     ```\\n   - Repeat for each new node.\\n\\n5. **Verify Node Addition**\\n   - Confirm new nodes appear:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -c -h <existing-node-host> cluster nodes\\n     ```\\n\\n## C. Resharding (Distributing Keyslots)\\n6. **Check Current Slot Assignments**\\n   - As shown above, run:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -c -h <any-node-host> cluster slots\\n     ```\\n\\n7. **Calculate New Slot Distribution**\\n   - Determine how many slots each node should own (e.g., total 16384 divided equally).\\n\\n8. **Reshard Slots**\\n   - Use the `redis-cli --cluster reshard` command:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli --cluster reshard <any-node-host>:6379\\n     ```\\n   - Follow prompts to specify:\\n     - Number of slots to move\\n     - Source and destination nodes\\n     - Confirm the resharding plan\\n\\n9. **Monitor Resharding Progress**\\n   - Check cluster info:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -c -h <any-node-host> cluster info\\n     ```\\n   - Ensure `cluster_slots_pfail` and `cluster_slots_fail` remain 0.\\n\\n## D.

[primary fails (as determined by Sentinel), one of the replicas is promoted to primary.\\nClients are configured to connect to the sentinels which will then direct them to the current primary; there is no load\\nbalancer involved in this path. Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., ```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n1)  1) \"name\"\\n2) \"gstg-redis-cache\"        # cluster_id\\n3) \"ip\"\\n4) \"10.224.8.103\"            # ip address of the current master\\n5) \"port\"\\n6) \"6379\"\\n7) \"runid\"\\n8) \"06277f7abca059c268b2c5e2b2581d7d3bf330f1\"\\n9) \"flags\"\\n10) \"master\"\\n11) \"link-pending-commands\"\\n12) \"0\"\\n13) \"link-refcount\"\\n14) \"1\"\\n15) \"last-ping-sent\"\\n16) \"0\"\\n17) \"last-ok-ping-reply\"\\n18) \"440\"\\n19) \"last-ping-reply\"\\n20) \"440\"\\n21) \"down-after-milliseconds\"\\n22) \"10000\"\\n23) \"info-refresh\"\\n24) \"9021\"\\n25) \"role-reported\"\\n26) \"master\"\\n27) \"role-reported-time\"\\n28) \"956691745\"\\n29) \"config-epoch\"\\n30) \"51\"\\n31) \"num-slaves\"\\n32) \"2\"\\n33) \"num-other-sentinels\"\\n34) \"2\"\\n35) \"quorum\"\\n36) \"2\"\\n37) \"failover-timeout\"\\n38) \"60000\"\\n39) \"parallel-syncs\"\\n40) \"1\"\\n```\\n1.

[Section titled “Is redis running?”](#is-redis-running) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana) Grafana dashboards: - [redis](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-main/redis-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-cache](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sidekiq](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-tracechunks](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-tracechunks-main/redis-tracechunks-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-ratelimiting](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-ratelimiting-main/redis-ratelimiting-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sessions](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sessions-main/redis-sessions-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) For example, there is a Grafana chart showing number of slowlog events in redis-sidekiq (not linking it here because the panel ID changes when Grafana dashboards are deployed). ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos) <https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1w&g0.expr=redis_up%20%3C%201&g0.tab=0> ### directly on a redis host [Section titled “directly on a redis host”](#directly-on-a-redis-host) - is redis up? - `gitlab-ctl status` - can we dial redis? - `telnet localhost 6379` - can we talk to redis via `redis-cli`? ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info ``` ## How to get redis stats? [Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1) [see above](#grafana) ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1) Redis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` . It is scraped by Prometheus. See [the exporter documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) for more details. [Example `redis_exporter` metric](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=redis_commands_processed_total&g0.tab=1) in Thanos. ### redis-cli [Section titled “redis-cli”](#redis-cli) Run: - [INFO command](https://redis.io/commands/info) - [MEMORY\\_STATS command](https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats) NOTE: DO NOT USE [MONITOR] COMMAND! It streams back every command processed by the Redis server which can double the use of resources. It can overload a production machine making it unresponsive or causing an OOM kill. NOTE: DO NOT USE [KEYS] COMMAND! It will overload a production machine. ## What is causing Redis to slowdown? [Section titled “What is causing Redis to slowdown?”](#what-is-causing-redis-to-slowdown) The application relies on Redis throughput to be very high, latency spikes can be detrimental to the operation of the entire application. ### Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana”](#prometheusthanosgrafana) Explore Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana. Historical metrics might suggest a sudden change in the application behavior or traffic, for example: - operations rate, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=54> - keys rate of change, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=64> For Grafana links [see above](#grafana). ### slowlog [Section titled “slowlog”](#slowlog) The slowlog records slow Redis queries. Redis [SLOWLOG command documentation](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog). Get top 10 Redis slowlog entries: Terminal window ``` > slowlog get 10 1) 1) (integer) 5100 # A unique progressive identifier for every slow log entry. 2) (integer) 1561019091 # The unix timestamp at which the logged command was processed. 3) (integer) 21390 # The amount of time needed for its execution, in microseconds. 4) 1) \"del\" # The array composing the arguments of the command. 2) \"cache:gitlab:242234:8213877:Ci::CompareTestReportsService\" ``` To convert the timestamp, use `date -d @1561019091`. Get the command execution time threshold at which commands are logged (in microseconds): ``` > config get slowlog-log-slower-than ``` Get size of slowlog (entries are discarded like in a FIFO queue): ``` > config get slowlog-max-len ``` #### Monitoring number of slowlog entries [Section titled “Monitoring number of slowlog entries”](#monitoring-number-of-slowlog-entries) The number of entries added to the slowlog is exposed as a Prometheus metric and [there is a Grafana chart for it](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=48). #### Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog [Section titled “Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog”](#monitoring-the-rate-of-change-in-the-slowlog) A useful metric for monitoring potential slow-downs in Redis is measuring the rate of change in the `redis_slowlog_last_id`. This can be done by plotting (`changes(redis_slowlog_last_id[1h])`](../<https://prometheus.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1d&g0.expr=changes(redis_slowlog_last_id%5B1h%5D)&g0.tab=0>). ### Redis latency monitoring framework [Section titled “Redis latency monitoring framework”](#redis-latency-monitoring-framework) Redis provides a latency diagnostic tool: <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> You may need to enable it with `CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100`. From <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> : By default monitoring is disabled (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. However while the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well. #### LATENCY DOCTOR [Section titled “LATENCY DOCTOR”](#latency-doctor) Terminal window ``` > CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100 > LATENCY DOCTOR Dave, I have observed latency spikes in this Redis instance. You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave? 1. command: 5 latency spikes (average 300ms, mean deviation 120ms, period 73.40 sec). Worst all time event 500ms. I have a few advices for you: - Your current Slow Log configuration only logs events that are slower than your configured latency monitor threshold. Please use 'CONFIG, <2-hop>\\n\\npresented are an optimistic estimate, as redis will require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over. This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1> - Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example: Terminal window ``` $ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master 2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec') ``` #### Redis Sentinel [Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel)]  ### 1. Direct Answer\\nFailover and recovery procedures are essential tools for troubleshooting Redis slowdown causes and replication issues because they help identify whether the primary node's performance or replication state is contributing to problems. By intentionally triggering failover or recovering nodes, SREs can observe how Redis and Sentinel behave under stress, verify replication health, and isolate whether issues stem from node saturation, network partitions, or configuration problems. These procedures also facilitate restoring service availability when nodes are unresponsive or experiencing saturation, enabling further diagnosis of underlying causes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### A. Diagnosing Redis Slowdown Using Failover Procedures\\n1. **Check Sentinel Health Checks**\\n   - Use the command:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL masters\\n     ```\\n   - Confirm the current master and replica status, especially `down-after-milliseconds` and `flags`.\\n\\n2. **Identify Saturation or Slow Nodes**\\n   - Use Redis info:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <redis_port> info\\n     ```\\n   - Look for high `used_cpu_sys`, `used_cpu_user`, or `instantaneous_ops_per_sec`.\\n   - Check for slow logs:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <redis_port> SLOWLOG GET\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Trigger a Failover (if primary is suspected to be slow)**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <master_name>\\n     ```\\n   - Observe Sentinel logs and behavior:\\n     ```\\n     tail -f /var/log/gitlab/sentinel/current\\n     ```\\n   - This promotes a replica to primary, allowing you to see if the new primary handles load better.\\n\\n4. **Monitor Replication and Client Behavior**\\n   - Check replication status:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <redis_port> INFO replication\\n     ```\\n   - Look for `master_sync_in_progress`, `slave_repl_offset`, and `connected_slaves`.\\n\\n5. **Assess Post-Failover Performance**\\n   - Use Redis info and slowlog to compare performance before and after failover.\\n   - Check if the new primary is less saturated or experiencing fewer latency spikes.\\n\\n#### B. Recovering from Node Saturation or Failures\\n1. **Identify Saturated Nodes**\\n   - Use `INFO` and `SLOWLOG` to confirm saturation.\\n   - Check system metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O).\\n\\n2. **Restart or Reconfigure Redis**\\n   - If needed, restart Redis:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n     ```\\n   - Or, temporarily disable resource-intensive commands:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <redis_port> CONFIG SET client-output-buffer-limit \"slave 0 0 0\"\\n     ```\\n   - Revert after stabilization:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <redis_port> CONFIG SET client-output-buffer-limit <original_value>\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Resynchronize Replicas if Needed**\\n   - If replication is flapping, trigger a manual failover:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <master_name>\\n     ```\\n   - Or, reconfigure replicas:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <redis_port> REPLICAOF <primary_ip> <primary_port>\\n     ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- Check Sentinel masters:\\n  ```\\n  SENTINEL masters\\n  ```\\n- Trigger failover:\\n  ```\\n  SENTINEL failover <master_name>\\n  ```\\n- Check Redis info:\\n  ```\\n  INFO\\n  ```\\n- Check replication status:\\n  ```\\n  INFO replication\\n  ```\\n- View slow logs:\\n  ```\\n  SLOWLOG GET\\n  ```\\n- Temporarily disable client output buffer limits:\\n  ```\\n  CONFIG SET client-output-buffer-limit \"slave 4294967296 4294967296 0\"\\n  ```\\n- Restart Redis:\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have appropriate permissions and access to Sentinel logs and Redis CLI.\\n- **Caution:** Avoid using `MONITOR` or `KEYS` commands in production as they can overload Redis.\\n- **Monitoring:** Always monitor system metrics and logs during failover or recovery to detect underlying issues.\\n- **Configuration:** After troubleshooting, revert any temporary configuration changes to prevent resource exhaustion.\\n- **Coordination:** Coordinate with your team before triggering failovers in production to avoid unnecessary disruptions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:** Failover and recovery procedures are vital for isolating whether Redis slowdown is due to node saturation, network issues, or replication problems. They enable controlled testing of Redis behavior under stress, facilitate resynchronization, and help restore service while providing insights into the root causes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Failover and recovery procedures are essential for addressing redis slowdown causes and replication issues by ensuring that Redis can quickly switch to a healthy master if the current one fails, and by restoring replication links. These procedures include building new Redis servers, starting replication with 'slaveof' commands, and using Sentinel to manage automatic failover. Properly executing these steps helps maintain high availability, reduces latency spikes, and resolves replication problems, thereby improving Redis performance and stability.      1.000000          0.916707                1.0        0.333333            0.517617                    0.2\n",

Former attempts are documented here: - [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256) - [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358) ## Setting up instances [Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances) First, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely: - `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd` - `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1` - `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag` - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`) - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag` - `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`. - `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) When configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application. E.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes. **Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand. ### 1. Generate Redis passwords [Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords) Generate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using: ``` for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done ``` Update both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master): ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV> ``` Update the JSON payload to include the new instance details: ``` { ..., \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"redis_conf\": { \"masteruser\": \"replica\", \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"user\": [ \"default off\", \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\", \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\", \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\" ] } } } ``` Do the same for ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV> ``` Modify the existing JSON ``` { \"redis_exporter\": { \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"env\": { \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\" } } } } ``` ### 2. Create Chef roles [Section titled “2. Create Chef roles”](#2-create-chef-roles) Set the new chef roles and add the new role to the list of gitlab-redis roles in -infra-prometheus-server role. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3494). ### 3. Provision VMs [Section titled “3. Provision VMs”](#3-provision-vms) Provision the VMs via the generic-stor/google terraform module. This is done in the [config-mgmt project in the ops environment](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/). An example MR can be found [here](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5811). After the MR is merged and applied, check the VM state via: ``` gcloud compute instances list --project <GCP_PROJECT> | grep 'redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>' ``` You need to wait for the initial chef-client run to complete. One way to check is to tail the serial port output to check when the initial run is completed. An example: ``` gcloud compute --project=<GCP_PROJECT> instances tail-serial-port-output redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV> --zone us-east1-{c/b/d} ``` ### 4. Initialising the cluster [Section titled “4. Initialising the cluster”](#4-initialising-the-cluster) a. SSH into one of the instance: ``` ssh redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV>.c.<GCP_PROJECT>.internal ``` b. Run the following: ``` export ENV=<ENV> export PROJECT=<GCP_PROJECT> export DEPLOYMENT=redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE> ``` c. Use the following command to connect the master-nodes and initialise a working cluster. Add more shard FQDN where necessary. e.g. `$DEPLOYMENT-shard-<shard_number>-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379`. ``` sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster create \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-02-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-03-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 ``` Use the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..m}` where `n` is the number of shards and `m` is the number of instances per shard. ``` for i in {01,02,03}-{02,03}; do sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 sleep 2 done ``` Use the following command, to assign the replicas within each shard. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..n}` where necessary depending on the cluster-size. ``` for i in {01,02,03}; do for j in {02,03}; do node_id=\"$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster nodes | grep $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal | awk '{ print $1 }')\"; sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-$j-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal \\ cluster replicate $node_id done done ``` ### 5. Validation [Section titled “5. Validation”](#5-validation) Wait for a few seconds as the nodes need time to gossip. Check the status via: ``` $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal:6379 (9b0828e3...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.3:6379 (ac03fcee...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.4:6379 (f8341afd...) -> 0 keys | 5462 slots | 2 slaves. [OK] 0 keys in 3 masters. 0.00 keys per slot on average. $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster info | head -n7 cluster_state:ok cluster_slots_assigned:16384 cluster_slots_ok:16384 cluster_slots_pfail:0 cluster_slots_fail:0 cluster_known_nodes:9 cluster_size:3 ``` ## Configuring the applications [Section titled “Configuring the applications”](#configuring-the-applications) ### 1.

Direct Answer:**  \\nHashicorp Vault is used to securely manage and store Redis cluster passwords, providing a centralized, encrypted secrets management system. It allows SREs to retrieve, rotate, and control access to Redis passwords dynamically, reducing the risk of credential leaks and simplifying secret lifecycle management.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Access Vault**  \\n- Log into Vault with appropriate permissions.  \\n- Use the Vault CLI or API to authenticate (e.g., via token, AppRole, or other methods).\\n\\n**Step 2: Retrieve Redis Password**  \\n- Locate the secret path where Redis credentials are stored, e.g., `secret/data/redis/cluster`.  \\n- Use the command:  \\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv get secret/redis/cluster\\n  ```  \\n- Extract the password from the returned data.\\n\\n**Step 3: Use the Password in Redis Configuration**  \\n- Update your Redis cluster configuration files or environment variables with the retrieved password.  \\n- Ensure your application or Redis client fetches the password dynamically at startup or as needed.\\n\\n**Step 4: Rotate Redis Passwords (if needed)**  \\n- Generate a new password securely (via Vault or your password generator).  \\n- Store the new password in Vault:  \\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv put secret/redis/cluster password=new_secure_password\\n  ```  \\n- Update Redis configuration to use the new password and reload/restart Redis if necessary.\\n\\n**Step 5: Manage Access Control**  \\n- Use Vault policies to restrict who can read or rotate Redis credentials.  \\n- Regularly audit access logs via Vault audit logs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands:**\\n\\n- Authenticate to Vault:  \\n  ```bash\\n  vault login <token>\\n  ```  \\n- Retrieve Redis credentials:  \\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv get secret/redis/cluster\\n  ```  \\n- Store new Redis password:  \\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv put secret/redis/cluster password=<new_password>\\n  ```  \\n- (Optional) Generate a random password:  \\n  ```bash\\n  openssl rand -base64 32\\n  ```  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure Vault is properly configured with the correct secrets engine (KV v2 or v1) and policies.  \\n- **Security:** Limit access to Vault secrets via policies; do not hardcode credentials.  \\n- **Automation:** Integrate secret retrieval into deployment scripts or configuration management tools for seamless updates.  \\n- **Rotation:** Regularly rotate passwords to enhance security, and ensure Redis instances are updated accordingly.  \\n- **Auditing:** Use Vault’s audit logging features to track secret access and modifications.  \\n\\nThis approach centralizes Redis password management, enhances security, and simplifies secret lifecycle handling for your Redis clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hashicorp Vault is used to generate and store Redis passwords, which are then updated in the vault secrets and used for configuring Redis cluster instances and related services.      0.000000          0.923218                0.0        0.666667            0.450075               0.000000\n",

Per-session storage is typically fairly small (hundreds of bytes), but there are a lot of them, they are touched a lot by active users, and some can be big either naturally or unexpectedly.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nRedis is deployed in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis.\\n## Scalability\\n[Section titled “Scalability”](#scalability)\\nSingle threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis, but at initial move we are anticipating something in the order of 20% absolute CPU usage. Data storage for sessions is in the order of 10GB (at end of 2021).\\n## Availability\\n[Section titled “Availability”](#availability)\\nThe usual redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\n## Durability\\n[Section titled “Durability”](#durability)\\nSession data is an interesting hybrid; we do *generally* want durability/persistence, but can tolerate some loss of data (generally a log-out for affected users). As such while we persist to disk with RDB, we also have maxmemory and an eviction policy (volatile-ttl) that will, if necessary, evict data with the shortest TTL remaining (sessions that were close to expiry anyway). Alerting is set to tell us if we are approaching that state of affairs, but that policy gives us space to mitigate/manage the situation without disaster.\\n## Monitoring/Alerting\\n[Section titled “Monitoring/Alerting”](#monitoringalerting)\\nGenerally the same as other Redis clusters, but with special handling for monitoring maximum memory (as a proportion of the configured limit, not the system limit), and alerting if redis\\_evicted\\_keys\\_total raises above zero (meaning we missed memory saturation)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis-sessions/README.md)\\n[Previous\\nRedis Registry Cache Service](/redis-registry-cache/)   [Next\\nRedis Sidekiq Service](/redis-sidekiq/), - [Replication issues](#replication-issues)\\n- [Switch Master manually](#switch-master-manually)\\n- [Replication flapping](#replication-flapping)\\n- [Redis is down](#redis-is-down)\\n- [Failed to collect Redis metrics](#failed-to-collect-redis-metrics)\\n- [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)\\n- [BigKeys analysis](#bigkeys-analysis)\\n- [References](#references)\\n# Troubleshooting\\n## Is redis running?\\n[Section titled “Is redis running?”](#is-redis-running)\\n### Grafana\\n[Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana)\\nGrafana dashboards:\\n- [redis](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-main/redis-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-cache](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-sidekiq](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-tracechunks](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-tracechunks-main/redis-tracechunks-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-ratelimiting](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-ratelimiting-main/redis-ratelimiting-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-sessions](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sessions-main/redis-sessions-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\nFor example, there is a Grafana chart showing number of slowlog events in redis-sidekiq (not linking it here because the panel ID changes when Grafana dashboards are deployed).\\n### Prometheus/Thanos\\n[Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos)\\n<https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1w&g0.expr=redis_up%20%3C%201&g0.tab=0>\\n### directly on a redis host\\n[Section titled “directly on a redis host”](#directly-on-a-redis-host)\\n- is redis up?\\n- `gitlab-ctl status`\\n- can we dial redis?\\n- `telnet localhost 6379`\\n- can we talk to redis via `redis-cli`?\\n```\\nREDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info\\n```\\n## How to get redis stats?\\n[Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats)\\n### Grafana\\n[Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1)\\n[see above](#grafana)\\n### Prometheus/Thanos\\n[Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1)\\nRedis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` .

NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial>\\nFrom time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes.\\nSo, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take:\\n1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`\\n- This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel\\n2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel`\\n- Not sure why, but it’s minor\\n3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master:\\n1.

So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status.\\nIt’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time.\\n### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)\\n[Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses

Verification of config in a VM [Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm) Check the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference. ``` [ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME> => \"PONG\" [ gstg ] production> ``` ### 3. Configure Gitlab Rails [Section titled “3. Configure Gitlab Rails”](#3-configure-gitlab-rails) a. Update secret ``` vault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED> ``` For example, ``` vault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails ======================== Secret Path ======================== k8s/data/env/gprd/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-rails ======= Metadata ======= Key Value --- ----- created_time 2023-03-18T00:33:29.790293426Z custom_metadata <nil> deletion_time n/a destroyed false version 1 ====== Data ====== Key Value --- ----- password <RAILS_REDACTED> ``` Note the version of the password in `vault kv get` and make sure it tallies with the external secret definition in [k8s-workload](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/master/releases/gitlab-external-secrets/values/values.yaml.gotmpl): ``` gitlab-redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails-credential-v1: refreshInterval: 0 secretStoreName: gitlab-secrets target: creationPolicy: Owner deletionPolicy: Delete data: - remoteRef: key: env/{{ $env }}/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails property: password version: \"1\" secretKey: password ``` Note that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets). b. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly. Either add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`.

Redis is managed via dedicated Chef cookbooks (`gitlab-redis`, `gitlab-redis-cluster`, and `omnibus-gitlab`) and configuration is handled through these tools and associated scripts, not through GitLab itself.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n1. **Identify the Configuration Management System:**  \\n   - Redis deployments are managed by Chef cookbooks (`gitlab-redis`, `gitlab-redis-cluster`, `omnibus-gitlab`) as documented in the runbook.\\n\\n2. **Check the Relevant Documentation:**  \\n   - Review the [Redis Overview section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/README.md#overview) which states that Redis is managed via these cookbooks.\\n\\n3. **Verify the Configuration Files and Scripts:**  \\n   - Redis configuration files (`redis.conf`) are generated and managed by Chef and Omnibus, not GitLab.\\n   - The reconfiguration process involves scripts like [`omnibus-redis-reconfigure.sh`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/omnibus-redis-reconfigure.sh).\\n\\n4. **Understand the Deployment Process:**  \\n   - Patching, failover, and reconfiguration are performed through Chef and scripts, not through GitLab interface or GitLab-managed configurations.\\n\\n5. **Additional Context:**  \\n   - The runbook explicitly mentions that GitLab's code repository (via GitLab.com) hosts runbooks and scripts, but not the Redis configuration management itself.\\n   - Redis is configured and maintained through Chef cookbooks and scripts, with no indication of GitLab being used as a configuration source.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Commands and Configuration Context:**\\n\\n- To reconfigure Redis after changes:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure\\n  ```\\n- To start Sentinel (if needed):\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel\\n  ```\\n- To manually set up replication:\\n  ```bash\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli\\n  # then run:\\n  slaveof MASTER_IP 6379\\n  ```\\n- To check Redis status:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl status\\n  redis-cli info\\n  ```\\n\\n**Important Notes:**\\n\\n- Redis configuration is automated via Chef cookbooks and scripts, not via GitLab.\\n- Changes to Redis configurations are performed through reconfiguration scripts and Chef, ensuring consistency across deployments.\\n- Always follow the documented procedures for reconfiguration and failover, avoiding manual edits to configuration files unless explicitly instructed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nGitLab serves as the platform hosting runbooks, scripts, and documentation, but it is not used directly for managing Redis configurations. Redis is managed through Chef cookbooks and scripts as part of the infrastructure automation process.

Per-session storage is typically fairly small (hundreds of bytes), but there are a lot of them, they are touched a lot by active users, and some can be big either naturally or unexpectedly.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nRedis is deployed in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis.\\n## Scalability\\n[Section titled “Scalability”](#scalability)\\nSingle threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis, but at initial move we are anticipating something in the order of 20% absolute CPU usage. Data storage for sessions is in the order of 10GB (at end of 2021).\\n## Availability\\n[Section titled “Availability”](#availability)\\nThe usual redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\n## Durability\\n[Section titled “Durability”](#durability)\\nSession data is an interesting hybrid; we do *generally* want durability/persistence, but can tolerate some loss of data (generally a log-out for affected users). As such while we persist to disk with RDB, we also have maxmemory and an eviction policy (volatile-ttl) that will, if necessary, evict data with the shortest TTL remaining (sessions that were close to expiry anyway). Alerting is set to tell us if we are approaching that state of affairs, but that policy gives us space to mitigate/manage the situation without disaster.\\n## Monitoring/Alerting\\n[Section titled “Monitoring/Alerting”](#monitoringalerting)\\nGenerally the same as other Redis clusters, but with special handling for monitoring maximum memory (as a proportion of the configured limit, not the system limit), and alerting if redis\\_evicted\\_keys\\_total raises above zero (meaning we missed memory saturation)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis-sessions/README.md)\\n[Previous\\nRedis Registry Cache Service](/redis-registry-cache/)   [Next\\nRedis Sidekiq Service](/redis-sidekiq/), - [Network partition](#network-partition)\\n- [Persistence Guarantees](#persistence-guarantees)\\n- [What do we store?](#what-do-we-store)\\n- [Clients](#clients)\\n- [What about redis cluster?](#what-about-redis-cluster)\\n- [Maintanence](#maintanence)\\n- [Reconfigure](#reconfigure)\\n- [Debugging and Diagnosis](#debugging-and-diagnosis)\\n- [Identifying the primary](#identifying-the-primary)\\n- [Basic stats](#basic-stats)\\n- [Slowlogs](#slowlogs)\\n- [ElasticSearch analysis](#elasticsearch-analysis)\\n- [Monitor commands](#monitor-commands)\\n- [Flamegraphs](#flamegraphs)\\n- [Bigkeys](#bigkeys)\\n# A survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab\\nSee also <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/redis.html> which covers some of the same\\nground, but with a developer orientation and the SRE-oriented [runbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md)\\n## What is Redis\\n[Section titled “What is Redis”](#what-is-redis)\\nRedis is a fast in-memory key-value store. It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability).

Sometimes we have incidents like\\n[#5478](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/5478) where we end up with invalid data in the cache, and no convenient way to\\nclear it. This document describes an approach for deleting a specified set of\\ncache keys on GitLab.com without consuming excessive Redis resources.\\nThis approach is split into two phases:\\n1. Obtain the keys to be deleted (against a secondary)\\n2. Delete the specified keys (against the primary)\\nBy doing this, we gain a few benefits:\\n1. We perform as few operations on the primary as necessary. Secondaries do not\\nreceive application traffic, and so have more headroom and can tolerate being\\nblocked briefly.\\n2. We can retain a list of deleted keys for later inspection - for instance, if\\na user reports an issue, we can check if their cache key was in the list.\\n3. Obtaining the keys to be deleted may be an iterative, exploratory process. We\\ndo not want to conflate this with data deletion, which should ideally be as\\nsimple as possible.\\n(In the future we may move to having [version-based cache invalidation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9815), where\\nthis will be simpler. One example is the way it’s possible to [invalidate the\\nMarkdown cache](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/invalidate_markdown_cache.html) - which is in Postgres, not Redis - via the API.)\\n## Step 1: obtain the keys to be deleted\\n[Section titled “Step 1: obtain the keys to be deleted”](#step-1-obtain-the-keys-to-be-deleted)\\n**On a secondary**, we can run a Ruby script like the below. `REDIS_PASSWORD` is\\nprovided as an environment variable.

Direct Answer:**\\nAn SSL Certificate is a digital credential used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between a client (like a web browser) and a server (such as Redis or a web server). It verifies the identity of the server and enables encrypted communication to protect data in transit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook and general knowledge):**\\n\\n**Step 1: Understand the Purpose of SSL Certificates**\\n- SSL Certificates enable encrypted communication and verify server identity.\\n- They are essential for securing data exchanged over networks, especially for sensitive information.\\n\\n**Step 2: Obtain an SSL Certificate**\\n- Generate a private key and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).\\n- Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA) to get a signed SSL certificate.\\n- Alternatively, generate a self-signed certificate for internal or testing purposes.\\n\\n**Step 3: Install the SSL Certificate on Redis or Web Server**\\n- Place the certificate and private key files on the server hosting Redis or the web service.\\n- Configure the server to use SSL/TLS by specifying the certificate and key paths.\\n\\n**Step 4: Configure Redis to Use SSL (if applicable)**\\n- Redis does not natively support SSL; use stunnel or a proxy to add SSL encryption.\\n- Configure stunnel with the SSL certificate and key, and point it to Redis.\\n- Update Redis client configurations to connect via the SSL-enabled proxy.\\n\\n**Step 5: Verify SSL Setup**\\n- Use tools like `openssl s_client -connect <host>:<port>` to test the SSL connection.\\n- Check that the certificate is valid and the connection is encrypted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands and Configurations:**\\n\\n- **Generating a CSR and private key:**\\n  ```bash\\n  openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout redis.key -out redis.csr\\n  ```\\n- **Installing SSL certificate files:**\\n  - Place `fullchain.pem` (certificate) and `privkey.pem` (private key) on the server.\\n- **Configuring stunnel (example):**\\n  ```ini\\n  [redis]\\n  accept = 6379\\n  connect = 127.0.0.1:6379\\n  cert = /path/to/fullchain.pem\\n  key = /path/to/privkey.pem\\n  ```\\n- **Connecting with redis-cli via SSL (using stunnel or proxy):**\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -h <host> -p 6380 --tls --cert /path/to/cert.pem --key /path/to/key.pem --cacert /path/to/ca.pem\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n- Redis does not natively support SSL; use stunnel or a similar proxy.\\n- Ensure the SSL certificate is valid and trusted by clients.\\n- For production, always use certificates signed by a trusted CA.\\n- Regularly renew and update certificates before expiration.\\n- Verify SSL configuration with testing tools to ensure secure setup.\\n- Proper permissions and security practices should be followed when handling private keys.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\nAn SSL Certificate is crucial for securing Redis communications. The process involves obtaining, installing, and configuring the certificate, often with an SSL proxy like stunnel, and verifying the setup to ensure encrypted, trusted connections.

Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Why partition?](#why-partition)\\n- [Timing](#timing)\\n- [Determining what to split off](#determining-what-to-split-off)\\n- [Implementation](#implementation)\\n- [Application changes](#application-changes)\\n- [Infrastructure changes](#infrastructure-changes)\\n- [VMs](#vms)\\n- [K8s](#k8s)\\n- [Redis-cluster](#redis-cluster)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Migration process](#migration-process)\\n- [Verification](#verification)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Why partition?](#why-partition)\\n- [Timing](#timing)\\n- [Determining what to split off](#determining-what-to-split-off)\\n- [Implementation](#implementation)\\n- [Application changes](#application-changes)\\n- [Infrastructure changes](#infrastructure-changes)\\n- [VMs](#vms)\\n- [K8s](#k8s)\\n- [Redis-cluster](#redis-cluster)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Migration process](#migration-process)\\n- [Verification](#verification)\\n# Functional Partitioning\\n## Why partition?\\n[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition)\\nRedis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done.\\nIn the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well.\\nThe other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system.\\n## Timing\\n[Section titled “Timing”](#timing), replication resynchronization). If all 3 nodes fail at once, the entire cache will be wiped; this is not ideal but\\nacceptable as it will be refilled on demand. For ratelimiting, the data has only short term usefulness anyway (generally\\n1 minute, with some up to 3 minutes) so complete loss is not significant.\\n## What do we store?\\n[Section titled “What do we store?”](#what-do-we-store)\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/419> contains some summary analysis of the keyspace across\\nthe persistent and cache instances, as at July 2020. This will change over time as the code base evolves, but the link\\nprovides some indication what we’re storing (it’s not as wide a range of things as you might expect in the\\npersistent instance).\\nThe data stored in the sidekiq instances is not really under our control (it’s whatever sidekiq needs to do its job).\\nSome details on that are available in [Sidekiq Survival Guide for SREs](../../sidekiq/sidekiq-survival-guide-for-sres).\\nThe data in the tracechunks instance is exclusively the output of CI jobs on its way into Object Storage (received by\\nand API request, written into Redis, and a Sidekiq job immediately scheduled to asynchronously write it to Object Storage);\\nwhile important, it is also extremely transient, and under normal circumstances there should be no significant build up\\nof data in this instance. Any such build up implies a problem (Sidekiq not processing, perhaps?) and so we have\\nparticularly low alert thresholds for memory saturation on this instance. At the time we chose to split this instance\\nfrom the primary persistent (shared state) instance (mid 2021), CI trace chunks were responsible for roughly 60% of the\\ndata throughput into/out of the shared state redis, and 16% of Redis calls.\\nThe data in the ratelimiting instance is a set of keys identifying actors (typically users, IP addresses, or in some\\ncases projects) and activities, with the value being the count of usage in the current period (the period is also encoded\\ninto the key name). TTLs are used to expire these automatically so there’s no manual cleanup by clients, it is automatic\\nand internal to Redis.\\nThe data in the sessions instance is exclusively that related to web sessions.\\n## Clients\\n[Section titled “Clients”](#clients)\\nMost of the clients are Ruby, specifically Rails code on the web, api, git, and sidekiq nodes. Workhorse (in Go) also\\n[uses](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/blob/master/README.md#redis) Redis to do long polling for CI build requests.\\nRails uses the generic [connection\\_pool](https://github.com/mperham/connection_pool) to maintain long running connections\\nwhich are used by threads/workers as necessary, which is particularly important as redis is typically expected to be\\nvery fast and low latency.\\nSee [High Availability](#high-availability) for some comments regarding connections via sentinels.\\n## What about redis cluster?\\n[Section titled “What about redis cluster?”](#what-about-redis-cluster)\\n[Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec) is a Redis feature that lets you horizontally shard data across\\nmultiple machines. If any one of our Redis clusters grows too large to fit in memory on a single machine or such that\\nthe single-threaded CPU becomes a hard limit, then Redis Cluster is a possible mitigation. Manually sharding the data\\nis an alternative approach, e.g. having more than one cache cluster and dividing the types of keys up in some way using\\napplication controlled logic, or splitting the sidekiq processing onto multiple clusters. Neither option is low effort.\\nSee the [Redis Cluster documentation for more details](../../redis/redis-cluster).\\nSee:\\n1. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9788>\\n2. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/305>\\n## Maintanence\\n[Section titled “Maintanence”](#maintanence)\\n### Reconfigure\\n[Section titled “Reconfigure”](#reconfigure)\\nIn order to apply config changes, we need to run a `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.

This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1>\\n- Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example:\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n$ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master\\n2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec')\\n```\\n#### Redis Sentinel\\n[Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel)\\nNOTE: At the moment of writing, Redis Cluster is not used anywhere in the gitlab.com infrastructure, we only utilize Redis Sentinel.\\nRedis Sentinel provides compatible clients with a pointer to the current Redis primary. Clients will query Sentinel and then connect directly to the primary Redis (in other words, Sentinel does not proxy requests).\\nAdditionally, Sentinel will reconfigure Redis instances as primary or secondaries, depending on the Sentinel clusters quorum.\\nFor more information see [Sentinel documentation](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel)\\nSentinel is configured via `gitlab.rb`:\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n$ sudo grep redis_sentinels /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb\\ngitlab_rails['redis_sentinels'] = [{\"host\"=>\"10.66.2.101\", \"port\"=>26379}, {\"host\"=>\"10.66.2.102\", \"port\"=>26379}, {\"host\"=>\"10.66.2.103\", \"port\"=>26379}]\\n```\\nwhich gets translated into `/var/opt/gitlab/sentinel/sentinel.conf`.\\n##### Get Redis master\\n[Section titled “Get Redis master”](#get-redis-master)\\nOnce you have the IP of a sentinel, use `redis-cli` to access sentinel. Sentinel usually runs on port `26379` (ie, Redis port (`6379`) + `20000`). The `sentinel masters` command will return a list of Redis primaries managed by this sentinel cluster:\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -h 10.66.2.101 -p 26379 sentinel

“Logging”](#logging) - [system](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/a10c2cd2b710f9eb65b13b9a2a328d51) The TraceChunks redis instances is a distinct redis cluster for storing CI build trace chunks immediately when received by the API from runners, before they are asynchronously (Ci::BuildTraceChunkFlushWorker) moved from there to ObjectStorage (as configured in .com; the database is another target option, but we don’t do that anymore). The data is important and persistent but transient (seconds to 10s of seconds normally, probably not minutes, definitely not hours, unless something has gone horribly wrong). This was split because as found in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327469#note_556531587> these trace chunks were (at the time) responsible for about 60% of the network throughput by bytes on the persistent redis, and 16% of the Redis calls, and it is a distinctive enough workload/usage pattern that splitting it out was deemed a good thing. Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters) Single threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then) The usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> ) Data is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable. Uses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover from. -]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   **1. Direct Answer:**  \\nGitLab.com is the hosted version of GitLab, a web-based platform for version control, CI/CD, and collaboration. It provides source code management, issue tracking, continuous integration, and other DevOps tools, all managed and maintained by GitLab Inc.  \\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook Documentation):**  \\nWhile the runbook primarily details Redis Sentinel and cluster management procedures, understanding \"gitlab.com\" in this context relates to the overall infrastructure that includes Redis clusters supporting GitLab services. Here’s how it fits in:  \\n\\n**a. Infrastructure Context:**  \\n- GitLab.com relies on Redis for caching, rate limiting, sessions, and other features.  \\n- Redis clusters are managed with Sentinel for high availability, automatic failover, and monitoring.  \\n- The runbook explains how Sentinel detects failures, promotes replicas, and maintains Redis availability, ensuring GitLab.com remains operational.  \\n\\n**b. Redis Failover and Monitoring:**  \\n- Sentinel monitors Redis nodes; if the primary fails, it promotes a replica to primary.  \\n- Clients (like GitLab services) connect via Sentinel, which directs them to the current primary.  \\n- Regular checks and reconfiguration procedures ensure Redis health, indirectly supporting GitLab.com’s uptime.  \\n\\n**c. Maintenance and Troubleshooting:**  \\n- Use Sentinel commands to identify the current Redis master, check replication lag, and verify cluster health.  \\n- Reconfigure Redis as needed with `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` during maintenance windows.  \\n- Monitor Redis metrics via Prometheus dashboards to ensure performance stability for GitLab.com.  \\n\\n**3. Key Commands and Configurations:**  \\n- To identify the current Redis master:  \\n```bash\\n/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -h <sentinel_host> -p 26379 sentinel masters\\n```  \\n- To check Redis configuration limits:  \\n```bash\\nredis-cli CONFIG GET client-output-buffer-limit\\n```  \\n- To verify Sentinel configuration:  \\n```bash\\nsudo grep redis_sentinels /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb\\n```  \\n- To reconfigure Redis after changes:  \\n```bash\\nsudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure\\n```  \\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**  \\n- No load balancer is involved; clients connect directly via Sentinel, which manages failover transparently.  \\n- Sentinel health checks depend on Redis responsiveness; slowness can trigger unintended failovers.  \\n- Always verify Sentinel and Redis health before making configuration changes.  \\n- In case of node failures, follow the runbook procedures to check Sentinel status, identify the master, and ensure proper failover.  \\n- Be aware that if all nodes fail simultaneously, GitLab.com will be down until recovery.  \\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nGitLab.com is the hosted platform that depends on a resilient Redis infrastructure managed via Sentinel.

It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability).

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n# Redis Cluster\\n## Core concepts\\n[Section titled “Core concepts”](#core-concepts)\\nRedis Cluster is a mode of Redis to enable horizontal scaling. The dataset is divided among multiple nodes, allowing the computational load to be distributed.\\nHow does Redis Cluster differ from non-clustered Sentinel-based Redis instances?, Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters)\\nSingle threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then)\\nThe usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\nData is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable.\\nUses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover

[Section titled “Logging”](#logging) - system The Chat Cache Redis Cluster instances is a distinct Redis Cluster used by the GitLab Rails [chat features](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410521). Redis is in a 3-node-per-shard (single-primary/two-replica per shard) VM configuration, in cluster mode. The node count will start off at 3 but will increase as we scale horizontally. Uses the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters.

Direct Answer:**\\n\\nConnecting to various services via Teleport allows SREs to securely access Redis, PostgreSQL, and Patroni clusters through a unified, authenticated, and encrypted tunnel. This simplifies multi-service management by providing seamless, role-based access to different infrastructure components, enabling efficient troubleshooting, configuration, and maintenance without exposing direct network endpoints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n**A. Accessing Redis, PostgreSQL, and Patroni via Teleport**\\n\\n1. **Ensure Teleport is Installed and Configured:**\\n   - Confirm that Teleport client (`tsh`) is installed on your workstation.\\n   - Verify your user has appropriate roles and permissions to access the desired services.\\n\\n2. **Authenticate with Teleport:**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     tsh login --proxy=<teleport-proxy-host> --user=<your-username>\\n     ```\\n   - Enter your credentials when prompted.\\n   - This establishes your identity and grants access based on assigned roles.\\n\\n3. **List Available Services:**\\n   - To see accessible services:\\n     ```\\n     tsh ls\\n     ```\\n   - Look for entries like `redis`, `postgres`, or `patroni`.\\n\\n4. **Connect to Redis:**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy redis\\n     ```\\n   - Or, for specific Redis instances:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy redis --cluster\\n     ```\\n   - This creates a local port forwarding (e.g., localhost:6379) to the Redis service.\\n\\n5. **Connect to PostgreSQL:**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy postgres\\n     ```\\n   - Or specify a particular database:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy postgres --db=<database-name>\\n     ```\\n\\n6. **Connect to Patroni (PostgreSQL HA management):**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy patroni\\n     ```\\n   - This provides access to the Patroni API endpoints for cluster management.\\n\\n**B. Managing Multi-Service Access**\\n\\n- Once connected via Teleport, SREs can run Redis CLI (`redis-cli`), psql, or Patroni API commands locally, which are securely tunneled to the respective services.\\n- For example, to run Redis commands:\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379\\n  ```\\n- For PostgreSQL:\\n  ```\\n  psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U <user> <database>\\n  ```\\n- For Patroni, use API calls or `curl` commands to the local forwarded port.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands:**\\n\\n- **Login to Teleport:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh login --proxy=<proxy-host> --user=<username>\\n  ```\\n- **List available services:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh ls\\n  ```\\n- **Create port-forward to Redis:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh proxy redis\\n  ```\\n- **Create port-forward to PostgreSQL:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh proxy postgres\\n  ```\\n- **Access Redis CLI:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379\\n  ```\\n- **Access PostgreSQL:**\\n  ```\\n  psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U <user> <database>\\n  ```\\n- **Access Patroni API:**\\n  ```\\n  curl http://localhost:8008/cluster\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n\\n- **Security:** Teleport ensures encrypted, role-based access, reducing the risk of exposing direct network endpoints.\\n- **Permissions:** Ensure your Teleport roles include access to the specific services.\\n- **Session Management:** You can open multiple tunnels for different services simultaneously.\\n- **Limitations:** Some commands may require specific environment variables or configurations; consult the runbook for service-specific nuances.\\n- **Prerequisites:** Teleport must be properly configured with the correct roles and access policies aligned with your infrastructure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nUsing Teleport streamlines multi-service management by providing secure, unified access to Redis, PostgreSQL, and Patroni clusters. This approach enhances operational efficiency, security, and troubleshooting capabilities for SREs managing complex Redis infrastructure alongside other critical services.  Connecting to various services via Teleport enables secure and streamlined access to multiple infrastructure components, including PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters, by providing centralized authentication and access management. This facilitates troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintenance of these clusters within complex setups. In the context of Redis infrastructure, Teleport's ability to connect to diverse services ensures that engineers can efficiently manage Redis databases alongside PostgreSQL and Patroni, supporting high availability and performance. By enabling multi-service access through a unified platform, Teleport simplifies multi-hop workflows, allowing engineers to perform multi-layered operations—such as connecting to Redis clusters, then accessing PostgreSQL or Patroni clusters—without compromising security or efficiency.      0.560000          0.805163                0.0        1.000000            0.955341               0.200000\n",
      "5  How do migration procedures for Redis sharding, including cluster setup and reconfiguration, relate to handling Redis failover events and master switch logs in ensuring high availability and performance?

The dataset is divided among multiple nodes, allowing the computational load to be distributed.\\nHow does Redis Cluster differ from non-clustered Sentinel-based Redis instances?\\nPropertySentinelClusterDatasetEvery node has the entire datasetDistributed over `n` nodesComputationPerformed by master nodePerformed by respective hash slot ownerOperationsAll standard operations allowedCross-slot operations are not permittedScalabilityOnly vertical scalingIncrease cluster’s shard sizeFailoversCoordinated by SentinelsCoordinated by a quorum of master nodes\\nReferences\\n- [Redis Cluster Specifications](https://redis.io/docs/reference/cluster-spec/)\\n- [Redis Cluster Scaling](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/)\\n## Glossary\\n[Section titled “Glossary”](#glossary)\\n**cluster**: A set of Redis nodes running in cluster-enabled mode. In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., cluster_slots_pfail:0\\ncluster_slots_fail:0\\ncluster_known_nodes:12\\ncluster_size:4\\n```\\n## Enable `debug` command on Redis Cluster\\n[Section titled “Enable debug command on Redis Cluster”](#enable-debug-command-on-redis-cluster)\\nAs mentioned in the beginning, most of the existing Redis Clusters do not have `debug` command enabled, which is needed to fix the cluster state as part of troubleshooting broken cluster.\\nThis step will enable the `debug` command by reconfiguring the existing Redis processes. Previous CR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18043).\\nRun this from chef-repo, to find the existing Redis servers and reconfigure them via `redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh` in the runbooks repository, excluding new shard as it was configured already with `enable-debug-command` above during provisioning.\\nCaution\\n`enable-debug-command` config option must already be enabled for newly added nodes during the time of provisioning otherwise failover wouldn’t work, which is required for reconfiguring the Redis process. Failover requires at least one keyslot to be present on the shard.\\nCaution\\nBefore running `scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh`, check the content of `$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt` for any `knife` logs, remove such lines if any.\\n```\\n# cd chef-repo\\nknife search -i \"roles:$ENV-base-db-$DEPLOYMENT\" | sort -V | grep -v $SHARD_NUMBER > /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n# cd runbooks\\nscripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n```\\n## Scale out cluster by resharding Redis keys\\n[Section titled “Scale out cluster by resharding Redis keys”](#scale-out-cluster-by-resharding-redis-keys)\\nThe goal here is to distribute the number of keyslots among all shards equally (With some rounding off). By default, we have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster. Until now, we just added Redis instances for new shard to the cluster, but they do not have any Redis keys (keyslots) yet and hence they are not serving any user requests.\\nIn this phase, we will migrate some keyslots from previous Redis shards to the new shard, so that new Redis instances start load sharing with existing Redis instances and hence lower their resource (CPU/Memory) utilization. Previous CR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18061).\\n### 1. Check the current keyslot assignments\\n[Section titled “1. Check the current keyslot assignments”](#1-check-the-current-keyslot-assignments)\\nGet the existing keyslot assignments and node IDs of the master nodes in the cluster, to prepare the commands required for migrating the keyslots.\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n```\\nFor example:\\n```\\n$ sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n1) 1) (integer) 0\\n2) (integer) 5460\\n3) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\"\\n2) (integer) 6379\\n3) \"9b0828e3379a06dc5bb749a106ab2cad9e47e4e4\"\\n4) 1) \"ip\"\\n2) \"10.217.21.10\"\\n4) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-03-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\"\\n2) (integer) 6379\\n3) \"f70faccea8b3dfc3ce4cdecfaa23b5dfb0ed06b8\"\\n4) 1) \"ip\"\\n2) \"10.217.21.5\"\\n5) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-02-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\"\\n2) (integer) 6379\\n3) \"3627d1e0b5962218a29eb852716fb23e5cb71265\"\\n4) 1) \"ip\"\\n2) \"10.217.21.8\"\\n2) 1) (integer) 5461\\n2) (integer) 10922\\n3) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-02-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\", ```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot.

Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.\\n**resharding**: Migrating ownership of some hash slots from one shard to another. This is a dynamic online operation, where Redis keys are migrated between nodes. During a resharding operation, reads and writes to the keys being migrated are semantically safe but incur some extra overhead. Also, multi-key requests may temporarily fail during the transitional state. There are some documented corner cases where a failed resharding attempt must be manually completed. In our environments, because we do not intend to dynamically add/remove nodes, resharding will be a rare and planned event (e.g. when adding new nodes to the cluster for additional capacity), not a frequent automated background activity.\\nreplica migration - an optional feature that allows the cluster to dynamically reassign a replica from one master to another, to ensure all masters have at least N replicas. This feature aims to improve availability. However, it can counter-intuitively harm availability in either of 2 ways: it can lead to a master and its replicas being in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140700451)), or it can lead to accumulating a majority of masters in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140436657)). This feature can be disabled ([cluster-allow-replica-migration](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1662-L1668)) or tuned ([cluster-migration-barrier](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1642-L1660)). This is one of the topics to be addressed by scalability#2071.\\n## Observability\\n[Section titled “Observability”](#observability)\\nFor most parts, the Grafana dashboard is the same as a Sentinel-based Redis dashboard. The difference lies in:\\n1. Cluster-specific panel: This panel tracks the slot coverage and state of nodes in the cluster.

Redirections should only happen on (1) failover (requests are redirected to the new master), (2) resharding (requests are redirected to the new slot owner).\\nCross-slot errors are prevented on the application side and should not reach the servers except for pipelined operations during resharding. The volume can be tracked on logs under 2 groups of fields:\\n1. `json.redis_<functional shard>_allowed_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of [allowed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/92312944bb8a827b5d00509a5d07d0fe8ee4955d/lib/gitlab/instrumentation/redis_cluster_validator.rb#L205) cross-slot calls (i.e. commands are accounted for and are running on non-cluster-based Redis)\\n2. `json.redis_<functional_shard>_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of cross-slot commands (not accounted for or running on Redis Cluster)\\n## Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “Troubleshooting”](#troubleshooting)\\n### What is the state of the cluster?\\n[Section titled “What is the state of the cluster?”](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\nSome commands to understand the overall state:, ```\\n`CLUSTER INFO` gives a fast overview of the state.

See the [originating issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2140) for more information.\\nIn the event where the sidecar processes are not working, the SRE/EOC will need to run the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](https://redis.io/commands/cluster-failover/) command on the desired slave node to promote that node into a master.\\nRun the following command on the desired

datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over.

[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition) Redis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done. In the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well. The other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system. ## Timing [Section titled “Timing”](#timing) The last two redis partitions that we have done took between 3 - 6 weeks to complete. The main factors that slow down or speed up the time required are the availability of reviewers for MRs, particularly for the application changes. In general, tamland forecasts capacity out approximately three months, which should give us adequate time to partition if required. ## Determining what to split off [Section titled “Determining what to split off”](#determining-what-to-split-off) This is more of an art than a science, as it will require some amount of knowledge of the usage patterns of the redis in question. We have documented how to [analyze memory usage](../redis#redis-memory-analyzer) as well as [keyspace usage and network traffic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md#keyspace-pattern-analysis), all of which can be combined to help determine what the largest chunk that makes logical sense to move is. ## Implementation [Section titled “Implementation”](#implementation) A lot of these processes are still a work in progress and will be modified based off of the results of [the epic to lessen sharding toil](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/886). ## Application changes [Section titled “Application changes”](#application-changes) - Create a new redis store class. It should inherit from `Gitlab::Redis::Wrapper`. Configure its `config_fallback` to be the current store from which you’re sharding off this workload. - Add `use_primary_and_secondary_stores_for_<store_name>` and `use_primary_store_as_default_for_<store_name>` feature flags, matching the name of the new store. - Update the relevant client code to use the new store. [Example issue and MRs.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2149) ## Infrastructure changes [Section titled “Infrastructure changes”](#infrastructure-changes) With the [current k8s overhead due to the networking stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/16871), we can only migrate workloads that are expected to remain well under saturation threshold to Kubernetes. [See discussion points here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2130). This means that in most cases, we’ll likely be functionally sharding off onto VMs, but I’ve included the k8s documentation for when we can shift to using that more. We presently do not have a well known method of creating a redis cluster shard, but that is work in progress as well. ### VMs [Section titled “VMs”](#vms) 1. [Create a chef role](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/blob/master/roles/gprd-base-db-redis-server-db-load-balancing.json) 2. [Provision in terraform](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5009) 3. [Configure with redis-reconfigure.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/redis-reconfigure.sh) Step 1 and 2 will leave the cluster in a strange state, with each redis host believing they are the primary and a somewhat confused sentinel quorum. In order to get things back in order, you’ll need to run chef-client, gitlab-ctl reconfigure, and set each secondary to be a replica of the primary. The redis-reconfigure.sh script does this for you. Terminal]  ### 1. Direct Answer\\nMigration procedures for Redis sharding, including cluster setup and reconfiguration, are integral to maintaining high availability and performance, especially during failover events. Proper cluster setup ensures that data is evenly distributed and resilient to node failures. Reconfiguration (like resharding) allows dynamic redistribution of hash slots to balance load. Handling failover events—such as promoting replicas to masters—relies on cluster awareness and failover mechanisms, which are documented procedures. Reconfigurations and failover handling work together to ensure continuous data availability, minimal downtime, and optimal performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### A. Cluster Setup & Initialization\\n1. **Create a new Redis Cluster:**\\n   - Follow the [official Redis guide](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/#create-a-redis-cluster).\\n   - Use `redis-cli --cluster create` with the list of nodes and options.\\n2. **Configure nodes with `enable-debug-command`:**\\n   - Reconfigure existing nodes to enable `debug` commands:\\n     - Run `scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh` after verifying `$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt`.\\n     - Ensure `enable-debug-command` is enabled during provisioning for new nodes.\\n\\n#### B. Handling Failover Events\\n3. **Monitor cluster health:**\\n   - Use `redis-cli cluster info` to check `cluster_state:ok`.\\n   - Check logs for `cluster_redirection` errors indicating MOVED or ASK redirects.\\n4. **Automatic failover:**\\n   - Redis Cluster automatically promotes replicas to masters during node failures.\\n   - Ensure `cluster-allow-replica-migration` and related configs are set correctly.\\n5. **Manual promotion (if needed):**\\n   - If automatic failover fails, run:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n     ```\\n   - Or, in emergency, force promotion of a replica:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n     ```\\n\\n#### C. Reconfiguration & Resharding\\n6. **Check current keyslot assignments:**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n     ```\\n7. **Reshard the cluster:**\\n   - Use the [official resharding guide](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/#reshard-the-cluster).\\n   - Migrate hash slots from existing masters to new nodes:\\n     - Use `redis-cli --cluster reshard` with appropriate parameters.\\n8. **Monitor redirections and cross-slot errors:**\\n   - Use Grafana dashboards and logs to track `cluster_redirection` errors.\\n   - Minimize cross-slot commands during resharding.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Check cluster info:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli cluster info\\n  ```\\n- **Check slot assignments:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli cluster slots\\n  ```\\n- **Force replica promotion (emergency):**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n  ```\\n- **Resharding:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli --cluster reshard <host>:<port>\\n  ```\\n- **Reconfigure nodes for debug commands:**\\n  - Run `scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh` as per runbook instructions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:**\\n  - Ensure `enable-debug-command` is enabled on nodes before reconfiguration.\\n  - Backup cluster state and configuration files before major changes.\\n- **Failover Handling:**\\n  - Automatic failover is designed to promote replicas; manual intervention is only needed if automatic failover fails.\\n  - Use `CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER` cautiously; it forces promotion.\\n- **Resharding:**\\n  - Resharding is a live operation; expect some temporary errors or redirections.\\n  - Avoid cross-slot multi-key commands during resharding.\\n- **Monitoring & Logging:**\\n  - Use Grafana dashboards to monitor redirection errors and slot coverage.\\n  - Review logs for `cluster_redirection` errors to identify issues.\\n- **High Availability:**\\n  - Proper reconfiguration and failover procedures ensure minimal downtime.\\n  - Regularly test failover and resharding procedures in staging environments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nMigration procedures—cluster setup, reconfiguration, resharding, and failover handling—are interconnected processes that collectively ensure Redis remains highly available and performant. Properly executing these steps, monitoring redirection logs, and responding to failover events maintain cluster health and data integrity.                                                                                                                                                                   Migration procedures for Redis sharding, such as setting up clusters and reconfiguring nodes, are essential for distributing workload and achieving horizontal scaling, which directly impacts high availability and performance. Proper cluster setup ensures that Redis instances can failover seamlessly during failover events, with master switch logs providing critical information about role changes and failover occurrences. By combining effective sharding migration techniques with vigilant monitoring of master switch logs, infrastructure engineers can maintain Redis high availability, quickly respond to failover events, and optimize performance within complex infrastructure setups.      1.000000          0.863381                1.0        1.000000            0.349060               0.090909\n",

While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes.\\nSo, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take:\\n1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`\\n- This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel\\n2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel`\\n- Not sure why, but it’s minor\\n3.

So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status.\\nIt’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time.\\n### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)\\n[Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis)\\nsee: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md>\\n### Replication issues\\n[Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues)\\n#### Possible checks\\n[Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks)\\n#### client-output-buffer-limit\\n[Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit)\\ncheck Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf>\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n> config get client-output-buffer-limit\\n```\\n#### Checks Using Prometheus\\n[Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus)\\n##### Redis Primaries\\n[Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries)\\nList the Redis primaries using:\\n- [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1)\\n##### Redis Secondaries]  [<1-hop>\\n\\n[PatroniGCSSnapshotDelayed](/patroni/alerts/PatroniGCSSnapshotDelayed/) -

Managing nodes from 1-hop and 2-hop info involves inspecting cluster state, node roles, and slot distribution, then performing add-node and replicate commands accordingly. Proper validation and configuration ensure a healthy, scalable Redis cluster.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Instructions for Scaling and Managing Nodes\\n\\n#### 1. **Assess Current Cluster State**\\n- Run:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <any_node_address>\\n  ```\\n- Verify:\\n  - `cluster_state:ok`\\n  - `cluster_slots_ok:16384`\\n  - `cluster_known_nodes` (number of nodes)\\n  - `cluster_size` (number of masters)\\n\\n*Note:* Use `CLUSTER INFO` for a quick overview.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 2. **Identify Existing Nodes and Slots**\\n- To get detailed node info:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster nodes <any_node_address>\\n  ```\\n- Check each node’s role (master/slave), assigned slots, and health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 3. **Add New Nodes (Scaling Up)**\\n- **Add a new node to the cluster:**\\n  - SSH into the existing master node or run from a management host.\\n  - Run:\\n    ```bash\\n    sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\\\n    <new_node_address>:6379 \\\\n    <existing_master_node_address>:6379\\n    ```\\n- **Add additional nodes (replicas or shards):**\\n  - For each new node, repeat the above, replacing `<new_node_address>`.\\n\\n*Tip:* Perform this on at least one node from each shard to avoid single-sided view issues.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 4. **Assign Replicas to Masters**\\n- For each replica node:\\n  - Find the master node ID:\\n    ```bash\\n    master_id=$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster nodes <any_node_address> | grep <master_node_address> | awk '{ print $1 }')\\n    ```\\n  - Run:\\n    ```bash\\n    sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h <replica_node_address> \\\\n    cluster replicate $master_id\\n    ```\\n- Repeat for all replicas.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 5. **Validate the Cluster**\\n- Wait a few seconds for gossip to propagate.\\n- Run:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <any_node_address>\\n  ```\\n- Confirm:\\n  - `cluster_state:ok`\\n  - All `cluster_slots_ok:16384`\\n  - Correct number of nodes and slots assigned\\n  - No fail or pfail slots\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Managing Nodes from 1-hop and 2-hop Info\\n- **1-hop info:** Directly querying a node (`CLUSTER NODES`) gives immediate info about that node’s role, slots, and connected slaves.\\n- **2-hop info:** To see the broader topology, query multiple nodes and cross-reference their `cluster nodes` output to ensure all nodes are correctly connected and slots are balanced.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Key Commands Summary\\n- **Check cluster info:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <node_address>\\n  ```\\n- **Get cluster nodes:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster nodes <node_address>\\n  ```\\n- **Add node:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node <new_node>:6379 <existing_node>:6379\\n  ```\\n- **Replicate node:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h <node> cluster replicate <master_node_id>\\n  ```\\n- **Validate cluster:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <node_address>\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n- Always perform scaling operations during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods.\\n- Ensure all nodes are reachable and properly configured.\\n- After adding nodes, monitor cluster health until `cluster_state:ok`.\\n- Use `CLUSTER SLOTS` or `CLUSTER SHARDS` to verify slot distribution.\\n- For large scale-up, consider online resharding to rebalance slots.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis procedure ensures a controlled, validated approach to scaling Redis clusters and managing nodes from both 1-hop and 2-hop perspectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      to scale up redis cluster and manage nodes, you need to create or recreate clusters from snapshots as described in the 1-hop context, and also perform scaling, upgrades, and maintenance activities outlined in the 2-hop context, such as geo patroni cluster management and managing redis cluster features, ensuring proper provisioning and management of redis nodes.      1.000000          0.762530                1.0        0.000000            0.430162               0.000000\n",

Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., ```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n1)  1) \"name\"\\n2) \"gstg-redis-cache\"        # cluster_id\\n3) \"ip\"\\n4) \"10.224.8.103\"            # ip address of the current master\\n5) \"port\"\\n6) \"6379\"\\n7) \"runid\"\\n8) \"06277f7abca059c268b2c5e2b2581d7d3bf330f1\"\\n9) \"flags\"\\n10) \"master\"\\n11) \"link-pending-commands\"\\n12) \"0\"\\n13) \"link-refcount\"\\n14) \"1\"\\n15) \"last-ping-sent\"\\n16) \"0\"\\n17) \"last-ok-ping-reply\"\\n18) \"440\"\\n19) \"last-ping-reply\"\\n20) \"440\"\\n21) \"down-after-milliseconds\"\\n22) \"10000\"\\n23) \"info-refresh\"\\n24) \"9021\"\\n25) \"role-reported\"\\n26) \"master\"\\n27) \"role-reported-time\"\\n28) \"956691745\"\\n29) \"config-epoch\"\\n30) \"51\"\\n31) \"num-slaves\"\\n32) \"2\"\\n33) \"num-other-sentinels\"\\n34) \"2\"\\n35) \"quorum\"\\n36) \"2\"\\n37) \"failover-timeout\"\\n38) \"60000\"\\n39) \"parallel-syncs\"\\n40) \"1\"\\n```\\n1.

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.]

[Section titled “Is redis running?”](#is-redis-running) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana) Grafana dashboards: - [redis](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-main/redis-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-cache](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sidekiq](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-tracechunks](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-tracechunks-main/redis-tracechunks-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-ratelimiting](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-ratelimiting-main/redis-ratelimiting-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sessions](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sessions-main/redis-sessions-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) For example, there is a Grafana chart showing number of slowlog events in redis-sidekiq (not linking it here because the panel ID changes when Grafana dashboards are deployed). ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos) <https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1w&g0.expr=redis_up%20%3C%201&g0.tab=0> ### directly on a redis host [Section titled “directly on a redis host”](#directly-on-a-redis-host) - is redis up? - `gitlab-ctl status` - can we dial redis? - `telnet localhost 6379` - can we talk to redis via `redis-cli`? ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info ``` ## How to get redis stats? [Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1) [see above](#grafana) ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1) Redis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` . It is scraped by Prometheus. See [the exporter documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) for more details. [Example `redis_exporter` metric](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=redis_commands_processed_total&g0.tab=1) in Thanos. ### redis-cli [Section titled “redis-cli”](#redis-cli) Run: - [INFO command](https://redis.io/commands/info) - [MEMORY\\_STATS command](https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats) NOTE: DO NOT USE [MONITOR] COMMAND! It streams back every command processed by the Redis server which can double the use of resources. It can overload a production machine making it unresponsive or causing an OOM kill. NOTE: DO NOT USE [KEYS] COMMAND! It will overload a production machine. ## What is causing Redis to slowdown? [Section titled “What is causing Redis to slowdown?”](#what-is-causing-redis-to-slowdown) The application relies on Redis throughput to be very high, latency spikes can be detrimental to the operation of the entire application. ### Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana”](#prometheusthanosgrafana) Explore Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana. Historical metrics might suggest a sudden change in the application behavior or traffic, for example: - operations rate, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=54> - keys rate of change, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=64> For Grafana links [see above](#grafana). ### slowlog [Section titled “slowlog”](#slowlog) The slowlog records slow Redis queries. Redis [SLOWLOG command documentation](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog). Get top 10 Redis slowlog entries: Terminal window ``` > slowlog get 10 1) 1) (integer) 5100 # A unique progressive identifier for every slow log entry. 2) (integer) 1561019091 # The unix timestamp at which the logged command was processed. 3) (integer) 21390 # The amount of time needed for its execution, in microseconds. 4) 1) \"del\" # The array composing the arguments of the command. 2) \"cache:gitlab:242234:8213877:Ci::CompareTestReportsService\" ``` To convert the timestamp, use `date -d @1561019091`. Get the command execution time threshold at which commands are logged (in microseconds): ``` > config get slowlog-log-slower-than ``` Get size of slowlog (entries are discarded like in a FIFO queue): ``` > config get slowlog-max-len ``` #### Monitoring number of slowlog entries [Section titled “Monitoring number of slowlog entries”](#monitoring-number-of-slowlog-entries) The number of entries added to the slowlog is exposed as a Prometheus metric and [there is a Grafana chart for it](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=48). #### Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog [Section titled “Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog”](#monitoring-the-rate-of-change-in-the-slowlog) A useful metric for monitoring potential slow-downs in Redis is measuring the rate of change in the `redis_slowlog_last_id`. This can be done by plotting (`changes(redis_slowlog_last_id[1h])`](../<https://prometheus.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1d&g0.expr=changes(redis_slowlog_last_id%5B1h%5D)&g0.tab=0>). ### Redis latency monitoring framework [Section titled “Redis latency monitoring framework”](#redis-latency-monitoring-framework) Redis provides a latency diagnostic tool: <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> You may need to enable it with `CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100`. From <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> : By default monitoring is disabled (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. However while the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well. #### LATENCY DOCTOR [Section titled “LATENCY DOCTOR”](#latency-doctor) Terminal window ``` > CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100 > LATENCY DOCTOR Dave, I have observed latency spikes in this Redis instance. You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave? 1. command: 5 latency spikes (average 300ms, mean deviation 120ms, period 73.40 sec). Worst all time event 500ms. I have a few advices for you: - Your current Slow Log configuration only logs events that are slower than your configured latency monitor threshold. Please use 'CONFIG, <2-hop>\\n\\npresented are an optimistic estimate, as redis will require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over. This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1> - Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example: Terminal window ``` $ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master 2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec') ``` #### Redis Sentinel [Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ### 1. Direct Answer\\nFailover and recovery procedures are essential in troubleshooting Redis slowdown causes and replication issues because they help restore service availability, isolate the problematic node, and ensure data consistency. By performing controlled failovers, you can determine if a slow or unresponsive primary is causing performance degradation or replication problems. Recovery procedures, such as re-establishing replication or promoting replicas, help identify whether issues stem from node failures, network partitions, or saturation, enabling targeted troubleshooting and minimizing downtime.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### A. Detecting and Confirming the Issue\\n1. **Monitor Redis health:** Use Sentinel or Redis CLI to check node status.\\n   ```\\n   /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <port> SENTINEL masters\\n   ```\\n2. **Identify slowdown or replication lag:** Use Redis slowlog or info commands.\\n   ```\\n   redis-cli -p <port> slowlog get 10\\n   redis-cli -p <port> info replication\\n   ```\\n\\n#### B. Initiate Failover to Test Resilience\\n3. **Perform a manual failover:** Promote a replica to primary to see if the new primary resolves the issue.\\n   ```\\n   /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n   ```\\n   - Replace `<CLUSTER_NAME>` with your cluster identifier (e.g., `gprd-redis-cache`).\\n\\n4. **Observe the new primary:** Check if the failover improves performance or resolves replication issues.\\n   ```\\n   redis-cli -p <new_primary_port> info replication\\n   ```\\n\\n#### C. Recovery Procedures\\n5. **Re-establish replication:** If a node is lagging or unresponsive, restart or resync the replica.\\n   - To resync a replica:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -p <replica_port> SLAVEOF <primary_ip> <primary_port>\\n     ```\\n   - Or, if needed, reconfigure the replica:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -p <replica_port> CONFIG REWRITE\\n     ```\\n\\n6. **Check for saturation or resource issues:** Use system tools and Redis info.\\n   ```\\n   redis-cli -p <port> info memory\\n   top / htop\\n   ```\\n\\n7. **Clear problematic data or logs if necessary:**\\n   - Delete RDB file after troubleshooting:\\n     ```\\n     rm /var/opt/gitlab/redis/dump.rdb\\n     ```\\n   - Remember to restart Redis after changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Check Sentinel status:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL masters\\n  ```\\n- **Force failover:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n  ```\\n- **Promote a replica manually:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <replica_port> SLAVEOF NO ONE\\n  ```\\n- **Reconfigure replica:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <replica_port> CONFIG REWRITE\\n  ```\\n- **Check replication info:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <port> info replication\\n  ```\\n- **Clear RDB file after troubleshooting:**\\n  ```\\n  rm /path/to/dump.rdb\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Caution with commands:** Avoid using `KEYS` or `MONITOR` commands in production as they can lock Redis or cause performance issues.\\n- **Ensure proper authentication:** Use the Redis admin password stored in secrets.\\n- **Perform failovers during maintenance windows if possible:** To prevent unintended data loss or service disruption.\\n- **Monitor Sentinel logs:** To identify causes of frequent failovers or flapping.\\n- **Resource checks:** Always verify system resources (CPU, memory, disk space) as saturation can cause slowdowns and trigger failovers.\\n- **Backup data:** Before deleting RDB files or making configuration changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:** Failover and recovery procedures help isolate whether slowdown or replication issues are due to node failures, resource saturation, or network problems. Controlled failovers test cluster resilience, while recovery steps restore replication and performance, enabling effective troubleshooting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Failover and recovery procedures are essential for addressing redis slowdown causes and replication issues by ensuring that Redis can quickly switch to a healthy master if the current one fails, and by restoring replication links. These procedures include building new Redis servers, starting replication with 'slaveof' commands, and using Sentinel to manage automatic failover. Properly executing these steps helps maintain high availability, reduces latency spikes, and resolves replication problems, thereby improving Redis performance and stability.      0.830189          0.956242                1.0        1.000000            0.879587               0.090909\n"

    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- LLM-based metrics (faithfulness, correctness) show high variability\n",
    "- Retrieval metrics (recall, entity recall) are more stable\n",
    "- This variability highlights the need for ensemble approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🎯 Why Choose 12→4**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **✅ Consistently High Answer Correctness** (+22.5% to +46.2%) - Strong technical accuracy across all runs\n",
    "2. **✅ Perfect Context Recall** (+21.4%) - Consistently retrieves most relevant documents\n",
    "3. **✅ High Context Entity Recall** (+292% to +308%) - Excellent command/entity coverage\n",
    "4. **✅ Balanced Performance** - No major weaknesses across metrics\n",
    "5. **✅ Optimal for Ensemble** - Provides strong foundation for combining with naive retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: While faithfulness shows variability (-11.0% to +25.1%), 12→4 consistently outperforms other configurations in correctness and recall.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **❌ Why Not Others**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **12→3**: Too restrictive, poor faithfulness (-18.4%), low correctness (+4.6%)\n",
    "- **12→5**: Best correctness (+42.2%) but terrible faithfulness (-29.4%)  \n",
    "- **12→6**: Mediocre across all metrics, lower correctness than 12→4\n",
    "\n",
    "**12→4 offers the best balance of faithfulness, correctness, and recall - perfect for ensemble retriever implementation.**\n"
