      "Query: How to monitor Redis memory usage?\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "### 1. Direct Answer\n",
      "To monitor Redis memory usage effectively, you should regularly check Redis memory metrics, set up alerts for high memory consumption (especially relative to your configured limit), and monitor eviction events. Use Redis commands like `INFO MEMORY` and `MEMORY STATS`, and leverage Prometheus metrics if available. Additionally, keep an eye on `redis_evicted_keys_total` to detect potential memory saturation issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 1: Access Redis CLI\n",
      "- Connect to your Redis instance using `redis-cli`:\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  redis-cli -h <redis-host> -p <port>\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Check Memory Usage\n",
      "- Run the `INFO MEMORY` command:\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  INFO MEMORY\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  - Review fields such as `used_memory`, `used_memory_rss`, `used_memory_peak`, and `maxmemory`.\n",
      "- Alternatively, run `MEMORY STATS`:\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  MEMORY STATS\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  - This provides detailed memory allocation info.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Monitor Memory Metrics Programmatically\n",
      "- Use `MEMORY STATS` or `INFO MEMORY` in your monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus exporters).\n",
      "- Set up dashboards to visualize:\n",
      "  - `used_memory`\n",
      "  - `maxmemory`\n",
      "  - `used_memory_rss`\n",
      "  - `mem_fragmentation_ratio` (ratio of `used_memory_rss` to `used_memory`)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 4: Set Up Alerts for Memory Saturation\n",
      "- Monitor `redis_evicted_keys_total`. An increase above zero indicates missed memory saturation:\n",
      "  - Use Prometheus or your monitoring system to alert if `redis_evicted_keys_total` > 0.\n",
      "- Also, alert if `used_memory` approaches your `maxmemory` setting (e.g., > 80%).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 5: Special Handling for Max Memory\n",
      "- Remember that monitoring should focus on the proportion of `used_memory` relative to your configured `maxmemory`, not the system's total memory.\n",
      "- Configure alerts based on this proportion to prevent eviction or OOM issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Key Commands\n",
      "- Check memory info:\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  INFO MEMORY\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- Get detailed memory stats:\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  MEMORY STATS\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- Monitor eviction count:\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  INFO stats\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  - Look for `evicted_keys` or use `redis_evicted_keys_total` metric if available.\n",
      "- (Optional) For latency and detailed diagnostics, enable latency monitoring:\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Important Notes\n",
      "- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have access to Redis CLI and monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) configured to collect Redis metrics.\n",
      "- **Caution:** Avoid using `MONITOR` or `KEYS` commands in production as they can overload Redis.\n",
      "- **Memory Monitoring Focus:** Always compare `used_memory` to your `maxmemory` setting to assess if Redis is nearing its configured limit.\n",
      "- **Eviction Alerts:** An increase in `redis_evicted_keys_total` indicates Redis is evicting keys due to memory pressure, which may require tuning or scaling.\n",
      "- **Latency Monitoring:** Enable latency monitoring if latency spikes are observed, but be aware it adds minimal memory overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:** Regularly run `INFO MEMORY`, monitor eviction metrics, set alerts for high memory usage relative to your configured limit, and use Prometheus dashboards for continuous visibility.\n",

[- [4. Troubleshooting](#4-troubleshooting)\\n# Provisioning Redis Cluster\\nThis document outlines the steps for provisioning a Redis Cluster. Former attempts are documented here:\\n- [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256)\\n- [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358)\\n## Setting up instances\\n[Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances)\\nFirst, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely:\\n- `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd`\\n- `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1`\\n- `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag`\\n- `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`)\\n- `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag`\\n- `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`.\\n- `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\nWhen configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application.\\nE.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes.\\n**Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand.\\n### 1.

Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm)\\nCheck the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference.\\n```\\n[ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME>\\n=> \"PONG\"\\n[ gstg ] production>\\n```\\n### 3.

Former attempts are documented here: - [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256) - [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358) ## Setting up instances [Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances) First, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely: - `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd` - `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1` - `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag` - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`) - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag` - `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`. - `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) When configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application. E.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes. **Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand. ### 1. Generate Redis passwords [Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords) Generate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using: ``` for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done ``` Update both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master): ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV> ``` Update the JSON payload to include the new instance details: ``` { ..., \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"redis_conf\": { \"masteruser\": \"replica\", \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"user\": [ \"default off\", \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\", \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\", \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\" ] } } } ``` Do the same for ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV> ``` Modify the existing JSON ``` { \"redis_exporter\": { \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"env\": { \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\" } } } } ``` ### 2. Create Chef roles [Section titled “2. Create Chef roles”](#2-create-chef-roles) Set the new chef roles and add the new role to the list of gitlab-redis roles in -infra-prometheus-server role. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3494). ### 3. Provision VMs [Section titled “3. Provision VMs”](#3-provision-vms) Provision the VMs via the generic-stor/google terraform module. This is done in the [config-mgmt project in the ops environment](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/). An example MR can be found [here](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5811). After the MR is merged and applied, check the VM state via: ``` gcloud compute instances list --project <GCP_PROJECT> | grep 'redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>' ``` You need to wait for the initial chef-client run to complete. One way to check is to tail the serial port output to check when the initial run is completed. An example: ``` gcloud compute --project=<GCP_PROJECT> instances tail-serial-port-output redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV> --zone us-east1-{c/b/d} ``` ### 4. Initialising the cluster [Section titled “4. Initialising the cluster”](#4-initialising-the-cluster) a. SSH into one of the instance: ``` ssh redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV>.c.<GCP_PROJECT>.internal ``` b. Run the following: ``` export ENV=<ENV> export PROJECT=<GCP_PROJECT> export DEPLOYMENT=redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE> ``` c. Use the following command to connect the master-nodes and initialise a working cluster. Add more shard FQDN where necessary. e.g. `$DEPLOYMENT-shard-<shard_number>-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379`. ``` sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster create \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-02-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-03-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 ``` Use the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster.

Direct Answer**  \\nHashicorp Vault is used to securely store, manage, and rotate Redis cluster passwords. It acts as a centralized secrets management system, ensuring that Redis credentials are kept confidential, versioned, and easily retrievable by authorized systems, reducing the risk of credential leaks and simplifying secret rotation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions**  \\n\\n**a. Generate Redis Passwords**  \\n1. Generate four secure passwords for Redis components:\\n   ```bash\\n   for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n   ```\\n2. Store these passwords in variables for later use.\\n\\n**b. Update Vault Secrets**  \\n3. Use `gkms-vault-edit` to update the `redis-cluster` secret:\\n   ```bash\\n   ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n   ```\\n4. Modify the JSON payload to include the new passwords and configuration, then patch the secret:\\n   ```bash\\n   vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n   ```\\n5. Repeat for `redis-exporter`:\\n   ```bash\\n   ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n   ```\\n   and update the secret similarly.\\n\\n**c. Store Passwords in Vault**  \\n6. Save the passwords in the appropriate JSON structure, ensuring they are associated with the correct Redis instance and component.\\n\\n**d. Update Application Secrets**  \\n7. Use `vault kv put` or `vault kv patch` to store the Redis password in the Kubernetes secret path:\\n   ```bash\\n   vault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED>\\n   ```\\n8. Verify the secret version with:\\n   ```bash\\n   vault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\n   ```\\n\\n**e. Configure Application to Use Vault Secrets**  \\n9. Update the application's configuration (e.g., `values.yaml`) to reference the Vault secret version, ensuring the application retrieves the correct password during deployment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands**  \\n- Generate passwords:\\n  ```bash\\n  for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n  ```\\n- Update Vault secrets:\\n  ```bash\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n  vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n  vault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED>\\n  ```\\n- Verify Vault secret:\\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\n  ```\\n\\n**4. Important Notes**  \\n- Vault centralizes secret management, reducing manual handling of passwords.\\n- Always generate strong, unique passwords.\\n- Follow safe secret rotation practices, especially when updating passwords.\\n- Ensure the application configuration references the correct Vault secret version.\\n- Proper permissions are required to access and update Vault secrets.\\n- Regularly audit Vault access logs for security compliance.\\n\\nThis process ensures Redis passwords are securely managed, rotated, and integrated into the deployment pipeline with minimal risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hashicorp Vault is used to generate and store Redis passwords, which are then updated in the vault secrets and used for configuring Redis cluster instances and related services.      0.789474          0.918728                1.0        1.000000            0.285688                    NaN\n",

It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability). It’s not a full DBMS with\\nguaranteed write semantics (and performance implications to match), but it is sufficiently persistent that there wouldn’t, Note that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets).\\nb. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly.\\nEither add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`.

Verification of config in a VM [Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm) Check the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference. ``` [ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME> => \"PONG\" [ gstg ] production> ``` ### 3.

Direct Answer\\nBased on the provided runbook documentation, GitLab is not used for managing Redis configurations directly through a centralized management system. Instead, Redis configurations are managed via configuration files (e.g., `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf`) and controlled through GitLab's omnibus `gitlab-ctl` commands. The runbook provides procedures for adjusting Redis settings and troubleshooting, but it does not indicate that GitLab uses an external tool like GitLab itself for managing Redis configurations automatically.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n**To manage or modify Redis configurations in the GitLab infrastructure:**\\n\\n1. **Access the Redis configuration file:**\\n   - The main configuration file is located at `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf`.\\n\\n2. **Make configuration changes:**\\n   - Edit the configuration file directly if needed.\\n   - For example, to change buffer limits, convert the desired size to bytes and set it via Redis CLI.\\n\\n3. **Apply configuration changes:**\\n   - Use the Redis CLI to set runtime configurations:\\n     ```bash\\n     REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set <parameter> \"<value>\"\\n     ```\\n   - Example for `client-output-buffer-limit`:\\n     ```bash\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set client-output-buffer-limit \"slave 4294967296 4294967296 0\"\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Restart Redis if necessary:**\\n   - If configuration changes require a restart, run:\\n     ```bash\\n     sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n     ```\\n\\n5. **Troubleshooting or further adjustments:**\\n   - Check logs at `/var/log/gitlab/redis/current`.\\n   - Follow runbook procedures for specific issues like Redis being down or metrics collection failures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Edit Redis config:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo nano /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf\\n  ```\\n- **Set runtime configuration (example):**\\n  ```bash\\n  REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set <parameter> \"<value>\"\\n  ```\\n- **Restart Redis service:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n  ```\\n- **Check Redis logs:**\\n  ```bash\\n  tail -f /var/log/gitlab/redis/current\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Configuration Management:** Changes are primarily made via configuration files and `gitlab-ctl` commands; there is no indication of GitLab using a dedicated external management tool for Redis configs.\\n- **Security:** Use `REDISCLI_AUTH` to authenticate when setting configs.\\n- **Restarting Redis:** Always verify if a restart is necessary after configuration changes.\\n- **Logs:** Monitor logs for issues, especially after changes or if Redis is down.\\n- **Caution:** Be careful when modifying buffer sizes or other critical parameters; convert sizes to bytes as specified in the runbook.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nGitLab manages Redis configurations through configuration files and `gitlab-ctl` commands, not via GitLab itself as a management platform. Use the provided commands and procedures to adjust settings safely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The context mentions GitLab in relation to verifying configuration in a VM, updating secrets, and configuring GitLab Rails, indicating that GitLab is used for managing redis configurations within the infrastructure setup.      0.937500          0.916782                1.0        0.500000            0.279921               0.000000\n",

Direct Answer\\nAn SSL Certificate (Secure Sockets Layer Certificate) is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and enables encrypted communication between the server and clients. It ensures data privacy, integrity, and security during data transmission over the internet.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook Procedures)\\n\\n**Note:** The runbook documentation provided does not directly detail SSL certificate procedures, but generally, the process involves obtaining, installing, and configuring certificates for secure communication.\\n\\n**Step 1: Identify the Need for an SSL Certificate**\\n- Determine if your service or website requires encrypted communication.\\n- Check if your current setup supports HTTPS or secure protocols.\\n\\n**Step 2: Choose the Type of SSL Certificate**\\n- Decide between options such as:\\n  - AWS Managed Certificates (recommended for AWS environments)\\n  - Self-signed certificates (for internal use)\\n  - Certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA)\\n\\n**Step 3: Obtain the SSL Certificate**\\n- For AWS Managed Certificates:\\n  - Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).\\n  - Request a new certificate for your domain.\\n  - Follow the prompts to validate domain ownership via DNS or email.\\n- For other CAs:\\n  - Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).\\n  - Submit the CSR to your chosen CA.\\n  - Complete domain validation as instructed.\\n\\n**Step 4: Install the SSL Certificate**\\n- For AWS:\\n  - Attach the ACM certificate to your load balancer, CloudFront distribution, or other AWS services.\\n- For other environments:\\n  - Download the certificate files.\\n  - Install the certificate and private key on your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache).\\n\\n**Step 5: Configure Your Service to Use SSL**\\n- Update your server configuration to enable HTTPS.\\n- Ensure the correct certificate files are referenced.\\n- Restart the server or service to apply changes.\\n\\n**Step 6: Verify the SSL Certificate**\\n- Use tools like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test.\\n- Confirm the certificate is correctly installed and trusted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands or Configurations\\n\\n- **Request AWS Managed Certificate:**\\n  ```bash\\n  # Using AWS CLI\\n  aws acm request-certificate --domain-name yourdomain.com --validation-method DNS\\n  ```\\n- **Generate CSR (for non-AWS CA):**\\n  ```bash\\n  openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout yourdomain.key -out yourdomain.csr\\n  ```\\n- **Install SSL on Nginx (example):**\\n  ```nginx\\n  server {\\n      listen 443 ssl;\\n      server_name yourdomain.com;\\n\\n      ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;\\n      ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;\\n\\n      # other configurations\\n  }\\n  ```\\n- **Restart Nginx:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo systemctl restart nginx\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:**\\n  - Domain ownership validation is required.\\n  - Access to your DNS provider or email for validation.\\n- **Security:**\\n  - Keep private keys secure.\\n  - Use strong encryption algorithms.\\n- **Renewal:**\\n  - SSL certificates typically expire after 1 year; set reminders for renewal.\\n- **Compatibility:**\\n  - Ensure your server and services support SSL/TLS protocols.\\n- **Additional Context:**\\n  - For AWS environments, leveraging AWS Managed Certificates simplifies management.\\n  - For internal or development environments, self-signed certificates may suffice but are not trusted by browsers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nAn SSL certificate is essential for securing data in transit. Obtain it via your preferred CA or AWS ACM, install it on your server, and configure your services to use HTTPS for encrypted communication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           SSL Certificate Expiring or Expired is mentioned in the context, indicating it is a certificate that may be nearing or past its expiration date, which is relevant for maintaining secure connections.      0.000000          0.797678                0.0        0.000000            0.107091               0.000000\n",

“Logging”](#logging) - [system](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/a10c2cd2b710f9eb65b13b9a2a328d51) The TraceChunks redis instances is a distinct redis cluster for storing CI build trace chunks immediately when received by the API from runners, before they are asynchronously (Ci::BuildTraceChunkFlushWorker) moved from there to ObjectStorage (as configured in .com; the database is another target option, but we don’t do that anymore). The data is important and persistent but transient (seconds to 10s of seconds normally, probably not minutes, definitely not hours, unless something has gone horribly wrong). This was split because as found in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327469#note_556531587> these trace chunks were (at the time) responsible for about 60% of the network throughput by bytes on the persistent redis, and 16% of the Redis calls, and it is a distinctive enough workload/usage pattern that splitting it out was deemed a good thing. Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters) Single threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then) The usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> ) Data is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable. Uses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover from. -]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ### 1.

It provides source code hosting, CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, and other DevOps tools as a SaaS service managed by GitLab Inc.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook Context)\\nWhile the runbooks focus on Gitaly and related storage/repository management, understanding what gitlab.com is can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n**a. Understand GitLab's Architecture:**\\n- GitLab.com is a SaaS platform that hosts Git repositories.\\n- It relies on various internal services, including Gitaly for repository storage and access.\\n\\n**b. Recognize the Role of Gitaly:**\\n- Gitaly handles Git repository storage and operations.\\n- It is a core component of GitLab's infrastructure, especially for high availability and performance.\\n\\n**c. For detailed operational procedures:**\\n- If managing repositories or troubleshooting, refer to relevant runbooks such as:\\n  - [Managing GitLab Storage Shards](https://gitlab.com/gitaly/storage-sharding/)\\n  - [Moving repositories from one Gitaly node to another](https://gitlab.com/gitaly/move-repositories/)\\n  - [Gitaly Repository Export](https://gitlab.com/gitaly/gitaly-repositry-export/)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- To interact with Gitaly or perform repository operations, use:\\n  - [`gitalyctl`](https://gitlab.com/gitaly/gitalyctl/) commands for repository management.\\n  - Example: `gitalyctl move-repo --repo <repo_name> --target <target_node>`\\n\\n- For troubleshooting or status:\\n  - Check Gitaly logs: `/var/log/gitaly/`\\n  - Use Prometheus metrics for performance insights.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Access to the GitLab infrastructure, proper permissions, and familiarity with Gitaly operations.\\n- **Caution:** Direct modifications to repositories or Gitaly configurations should be performed following the runbooks to avoid data corruption.\\n- **Additional Context:** GitLab.com is a managed SaaS, so most end-users interact via the GitLab web interface or Git commands, while administrators use runbooks for internal management.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\n**gitlab.com** is GitLab's cloud-hosted platform for source code management and DevOps workflows, supported by a complex infrastructure including Gitaly for repository storage. For operational procedures, refer to the relevant runbooks on Gitaly management and repository handling.

[Section titled “Logging”](#logging) - system The Chat Cache Redis Cluster instances is a distinct Redis Cluster used by the GitLab Rails [chat features](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410521). Redis is in a 3-node-per-shard (single-primary/two-replica per shard) VM configuration, in cluster mode. The node count will start off at 3 but will increase as we scale horizontally. Uses the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters.

Direct Answer**\\n\\nConnecting to various services via Teleport streamlines multi-service access by providing secure, unified, and auditable SSH access to infrastructure components such as PostgreSQL, Patroni clusters, and Redis. This approach simplifies management, enhances security, and enables SREs to perform administrative tasks, troubleshooting, and monitoring across multiple services without exposing direct network access or managing multiple SSH keys.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions**\\n\\n**Step 1: Ensure Teleport Access is Configured**\\n- Verify that your user account has the necessary roles and permissions to access the Teleport proxy.\\n- Confirm Teleport client (`tsh`) is installed and configured.\\n\\n**Step 2: Connect to the Teleport Proxy**\\n- Use `tsh` to authenticate and establish a session:\\n  ```\\n  tsh login --proxy=<teleport-proxy-host> --user=<your-user>\\n  ```\\n- Authenticate via your preferred method (password, SSO, etc.).\\n\\n**Step 3: Access Specific Services via Teleport**\\n- **PostgreSQL / Patroni Clusters:**\\n  - Use `tsh` to create a port-forward to the PostgreSQL or Patroni service:\\n    ```\\n    tsh proxy db --db-user=<user> --db-name=<dbname> --proxy=<teleport-proxy-host>\\n    ```\\n  - Alternatively, if configured, connect directly via local port forwarding:\\n    ```\\n    tsh port-forward <service-host> <local-port>:<service-port>\\n    ```\\n  - Connect using your database client to `localhost:<local-port>`.\\n\\n- **Redis:**\\n  - Use `tsh` to port-forward Redis:\\n    ```\\n    tsh port-forward <redis-host> <local-port>:6379\\n    ```\\n  - Connect your Redis CLI:\\n    ```\\n    redis-cli -h localhost -p <local-port>\\n    ```\\n\\n**Step 4: Manage Multi-Service Access**\\n- Repeat port-forwarding or proxy commands for other services as needed.\\n- Use Teleport's audit logs to track access and commands executed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands**\\n\\n- **Login to Teleport:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh login --proxy=<proxy-host> --user=<user>\\n  ```\\n- **Port-forward to PostgreSQL/Patroni:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh proxy db --db-user=<user> --db-name=<dbname>\\n  ```\\n- **Port-forward to Redis:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh port-forward <redis-host> 6379:6379\\n  ```\\n- **Connect to Redis:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -h localhost -p <local-port>\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes**\\n\\n- **Prerequisites:**\\n  - Ensure `tsh` (Teleport CLI) is installed and configured.\\n  - Your user must have appropriate roles assigned for service access.\\n  - Services should be registered with Teleport as database or application proxies.\\n\\n- **Security & Best Practices:**\\n  - Use Teleport's role-based access control to limit permissions.\\n  - Always terminate port-forward sessions after use.\\n  - Leverage Teleport's audit logs for compliance and troubleshooting.\\n\\n- **Additional Context:**\\n  - Teleport acts as a secure bastion, eliminating the need for direct network exposure.\\n  - It simplifies multi-service management by providing a single access point.\\n  - This setup is especially beneficial in multi-service environments like Redis, PostgreSQL, Patroni, and others, ensuring consistent security and operational procedures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nConnecting via Teleport allows SREs to securely access and manage PostgreSQL, Patroni, Redis, and other services through unified, auditable sessions. This reduces complexity, enhances security, and facilitates efficient multi-service management.  Connecting to various services via Teleport enables secure and streamlined access to multiple infrastructure components, including PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters, by providing centralized authentication and access management. This facilitates troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintenance of these clusters within complex setups. In the context of Redis infrastructure, Teleport's ability to connect to diverse services ensures that engineers can efficiently manage Redis databases alongside PostgreSQL and Patroni, supporting high availability and performance. By enabling multi-service access through a unified platform, Teleport simplifies multi-hop workflows, allowing engineers to perform multi-layered operations—such as connecting to Redis clusters, then accessing PostgreSQL or Patroni clusters—without compromising security or efficiency.      0.000000          0.666765                1.0        1.000000            0.943965               0.000000\n",

[```\\nKeep a check on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n```\\n- During and after migration, Redis clients will receive `redirections` to contact the new owner of keyslots. These are not errors themselves as Redis clients would update their internal mapping of `keyslot -> master` upon receiving redirection from server. The redirections will take time to taper off and will definitely be gone after a new deployment in the environment, as all pods will be rotated in that scenario and will start off with up-to-date keyslot mapping.\\n## Key metrics to observe\\n[Section titled “Key metrics to observe”](#key-metrics-to-observe)\\nBelow is a list of some of the key metrics to check for:\\n- Redis service error ratio e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?from=now-6h&orgId=1&to=now&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=3422679610)\\n- Redis Cluster Slots Failed e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?orgId=1&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=115&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- Redirections for the clients e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?orgId=1&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=117&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis/scaling-redis-cluster.md)\\n[Previous\\nA survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab](/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres/)   [Next\\nRedis Cluster Cache Service](/redis-cluster-cache/), - (1) is FQDN of the Redis server\\n- (2) is the port number of Redis server\\n- **(3) is the node ID of the Redis instance** and required in resharding commands\\n- (4) is IP address of Redis instance\\n### 2. Calibrate the batch size for migration\\n[Section titled “2. Calibrate the batch size for migration”](#2-calibrate-the-batch-size-for-migration)\\nAt first, make a few migrations with incrementally increasing `BATCH_SIZE`, to determine a suitable size which does not cause large CPU/memory saturation spikes on the existing Redis instances and also is fast enough to complete migration within a few hours. Larger `BATCH_SIZE` will finish faster but will consume more CPU/memory due to concurrent read/writes and also compete with user requests, specially if keys have large values e.g. `set`, `list` or any other multi-value type data.\\nDuring previous migration in `redis-cluster-ratelimiting`, a `BATCH_SIZE` of 30 was used and moving 1365 keyslots took less than [5 seconds](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18061#note_1924076365).\\nVariables that need to be replaced in command below are:\\n- `FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **from** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `TO_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **to** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE`: number of keyslots to be migrated\\n- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of redis keys to be read and written from one master to another\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n# Trial runs to move some keyslots with batch size 30 to get time taken and its impact on CPU/Memory utilization\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nAt the same time, keep an eye on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. Also, note the time taken for migration of keyslots to estimate required time for completing the migration. If there is no impact on resources and time taken by migration is not reasonable, then try increasing the `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` to a workable number.\\n### 3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard\\n[Section titled “3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard”](#3-migrate-keys-from-existing-shards-to-new-shard)\\nWe have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster and a cluster with 3 shards have distribution like following:\\n1. First shard: 0-5460\\n2. Second shard: 5461-10922\\n3. Third shard: 10923-16383\\nIn this case, a new fourth shard will intake equal number of keyslots from all 3 existing shards, so 1365 keyslots from each (after round off).\\nOnce `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` have been determined, migrate the keyslots from each of existing shards to the new shard using:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nKeep a check on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```, ```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.\\n**resharding**: Migrating ownership of some hash slots from one shard to another. This is a dynamic online operation, where Redis keys are migrated between nodes. During a resharding operation, reads and writes to the keys being migrated are semantically safe but incur some extra overhead. Also, multi-key requests may temporarily fail during the transitional state. There are some documented corner cases where a failed resharding attempt must be manually completed. In our environments, because we do not intend to dynamically add/remove nodes, resharding will be a rare and planned event (e.g. when adding new nodes to the cluster for additional capacity), not a frequent automated background activity.\\nreplica migration - an optional feature that allows the cluster to dynamically reassign a replica from one master to another, to ensure all masters have at least N replicas. This feature aims to improve availability. However, it can counter-intuitively harm availability in either of 2 ways: it can lead to a master and its replicas being in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140700451)), or it can lead to accumulating a majority of masters in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140436657)). This feature can be disabled ([cluster-allow-replica-migration](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1662-L1668)) or tuned ([cluster-migration-barrier](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1642-L1660)). This is one of the topics to be addressed by scalability#2071.\\n## Observability\\n[Section titled “Observability”](#observability)\\nFor most parts, the Grafana dashboard is the same as a Sentinel-based Redis dashboard. The difference lies in:\\n1. Cluster-specific panel: This panel tracks the slot coverage and state of nodes in the cluster. The components are defined in [`libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/ff4ff9dd29ee417a4a7d1940178c3085cc25730f/libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet#L449).\\n2. `cluster_redirection` error SLI - tracks the rate of MOVED and ASK redirections. Redirections should only happen on (1) failover (requests are redirected to the new master), (2) resharding (requests are redirected to the new slot owner).\\nCross-slot errors are prevented on the application side and should not reach the servers except for pipelined operations during resharding. The volume can be tracked on logs under 2 groups of fields:\\n1. `json.redis_<functional shard>_allowed_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of [allowed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/92312944bb8a827b5d00509a5d07d0fe8ee4955d/lib/gitlab/instrumentation/redis_cluster_validator.rb#L205) cross-slot calls (i.e. commands are accounted for and are running on non-cluster-based Redis)\\n2. `json.redis_<functional_shard>_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of cross-slot commands (not accounted for or running on Redis Cluster)\\n##

require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary.

[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition) Redis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done. In the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well. The other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system. ## Timing [Section titled “Timing”](#timing) The last two redis partitions that we have done took between 3 - 6 weeks to complete. The main factors that slow down or speed up the time required are the availability of reviewers for MRs, particularly for the application changes. In general, tamland forecasts capacity out approximately three months, which should give us adequate time to partition if required. ## Determining what to split off [Section titled “Determining what to split off”](#determining-what-to-split-off) This is more of an art than a science, as it will require some amount of knowledge of the usage patterns of the redis in question. We have documented how to [analyze memory usage](../redis#redis-memory-analyzer) as well as [keyspace usage and network traffic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md#keyspace-pattern-analysis), all of which can be combined to help determine what the largest chunk that makes logical sense to move is. ## Implementation [Section titled “Implementation”](#implementation) A lot of these processes are still a work in progress and will be modified based off of the results of [the epic to lessen sharding toil](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/886). ## Application changes [Section titled “Application changes”](#application-changes) - Create a new redis store class. It should inherit from `Gitlab::Redis::Wrapper`. Configure its `config_fallback` to be the current store from which you’re sharding off this workload. - Add `use_primary_and_secondary_stores_for_<store_name>` and `use_primary_store_as_default_for_<store_name>` feature flags, matching the name of the new store. - Update the relevant client code to use the new store. [Example issue and MRs.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2149) ## Infrastructure changes [Section titled “Infrastructure changes”](#infrastructure-changes) With the [current k8s overhead due to the networking stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/16871), we can only migrate workloads that are expected to remain well under saturation threshold to Kubernetes. [See discussion points here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2130). This means that in most cases, we’ll likely be functionally sharding off onto VMs, but I’ve included the k8s documentation for when we can shift to using that more. We presently do not have a well known method of creating a redis cluster shard, but that is work in progress as well. ### VMs [Section titled “VMs”](#vms) 1. [Create a chef role](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/blob/master/roles/gprd-base-db-redis-server-db-load-balancing.json) 2. [Provision in terraform](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5009) 3. [Configure with redis-reconfigure.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/redis-reconfigure.sh) Step 1 and 2 will leave the cluster in a strange state, with each redis host believing they are the primary and a somewhat confused sentinel quorum. In order to get things back in order, you’ll need to run chef-client, gitlab-ctl reconfigure, and set each secondary to be a replica of the primary. The redis-reconfigure.sh script does this for you. Terminal]  **Direct Answer:**\\n\\nMigration procedures for Redis sharding, including cluster setup and reconfiguration, are closely related to handling failover events and master switch logs. Proper migration ensures minimal disruption during failovers by maintaining cluster consistency, fixing hanging keyslots, and updating client redirection mappings. During failover, Redis redirects clients to the new master, and migration processes must be carefully managed to prevent broken cluster state, hanging keyslots, or inconsistent key distribution, thereby ensuring high availability and optimal performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n### 1. Monitor Cluster Health and Metrics\\n- Keep an eye on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics via the Redis Cluster dashboard.\\n- Watch for signs of resource saturation or increased redirection rates, which may indicate ongoing failover or migration issues.\\n\\n### 2. Prepare for Migration\\n- Calibrate your migration batch size (`BATCH_SIZE`) by performing trial migrations.\\n- Use the command:\\n  ```bash\\n  ssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n  time sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n  ```\\n- During this, monitor resource impact and migration duration.\\n\\n### 3. Execute Resharding (Migration)\\n- Migrate keyslots from existing shards to the new shard:\\n  ```bash\\n  ssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n  time sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n  ```\\n- Continuously observe metrics:\\n  - If resource impact is high, consider stopping (`ctrl + c`) and adjusting batch size.\\n  - After stopping, run:\\n    ```bash\\n    sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n    ```\\n  - This fixes hanging keyslots caused by interrupted migrations.\\n\\n### 4. Handle Failover Events\\n- During failover, Redis will redirect clients to the new master.\\n- Migration processes should be resilient to these redirections, which are normal.\\n- If cluster configuration breaks (e.g., due to process death or manual halt), run:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n  ```\\n- This ensures the cluster's hash slot to master mapping is consistent.\\n\\n### 5. Post-Migration and Reconfiguration\\n- After migration, verify cluster health:\\n  - Check for failed slots or redirection errors.\\n  - Confirm all keyslots are assigned correctly.\\n- Restart clients or pods to refresh their keyslot cache, reducing redirection overhead.\\n- Monitor key metrics to ensure no residual issues.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Commands:**\\n\\n- **Resharding (migration):**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <SLOTS> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n  ```\\n- **Fix cluster state after interruption:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Important Notes:**\\n\\n- Always monitor the `Redirections` metric; high redirection rates during migration or failover are expected but should taper off.\\n- Killing a migration process can leave keyslots in a hanging state; always run `--cluster fix` afterward.\\n- During failover, Redis automatically redirects clients; ensure clients are configured to handle redirections gracefully.\\n- Properly calibrate `BATCH_SIZE` to balance migration speed and resource impact.\\n- Run migrations during low-traffic periods if possible, and ensure cluster health before and after migration.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nMigration procedures are integral to maintaining high availability during Redis failovers. They involve careful resharding, handling redirections, fixing cluster inconsistencies, and monitoring metrics. Proper execution ensures minimal downtime, consistent data distribution, and optimal performance.                                                                                                                                                                   Migration procedures for Redis sharding, such as setting up clusters and reconfiguring nodes, are essential for distributing workload and achieving horizontal scaling, which directly impacts high availability and performance. Proper cluster setup ensures that Redis instances can failover seamlessly during failover events, with master switch logs providing critical information about role changes and failover occurrences. By combining effective sharding migration techniques with vigilant monitoring of master switch logs, infrastructure engineers can maintain Redis high availability, quickly respond to failover events, and optimize performance within complex infrastructure setups.      0.500000          0.840481                1.0        0.000000            0.323566               0.000000\n",

In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n# Redis Cluster\\n## Core concepts\\n[Section titled “Core concepts”](#core-concepts)\\nRedis Cluster is a mode of Redis to enable horizontal scaling.

Here's a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how to scale up a Redis Cluster and manage nodes from 1-hop and 2-hop information themes, based on the provided runbook documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 1. Direct Answer\\nTo scale up a Redis Cluster, you need to add new nodes (shards) and re-distribute keyslots (resharding) so that the load is balanced across all nodes. Managing nodes involves understanding the cluster topology via 1-hop and 2-hop info, reconfiguring nodes, and performing online resharding to migrate keyslots from existing nodes to new ones.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n## A. Prepare for Scaling\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Ensure `debug` command is enabled on all nodes (see \"Enable debug command\" section).\\n- Confirm cluster health: `cluster_slots_pfail:0`, `cluster_slots_fail:0`, `cluster_known_nodes:12`, `cluster_size:4`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## B. Add New Nodes (Shard) to the Cluster\\n1. **Provision New Redis Nodes:**\\n   - Deploy new Redis instances with `enable-debug-command` enabled.\\n   - Configure each new node with proper cluster settings.\\n\\n2. **Join New Nodes to the Cluster:**\\n   - Use `redis-cli --cluster add-node` to add each new node:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli --cluster add-node <new-node-ip>:6379 <existing-node-ip>:6379\\n     ```\\n   - Repeat for all new nodes.\\n\\n3. **Verify Node Addition:**\\n   - Check cluster nodes:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -c -h <any-node> cluster nodes\\n     ```\\n   - Confirm new nodes appear and are in `connected` state.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## C. Rebalance the Cluster (Resharding)\\n1. **Check Current Keyslot Assignments:**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n     ```\\n   - Note the ranges of hash slots assigned to each master node.\\n\\n2. **Initiate Resharding:**\\n   - Use the `redis-cli --cluster reshard` command:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli --cluster reshard <any-node-ip>:6379\\n     ```\\n   - Follow prompts to specify:\\n     - Number of slots to move\\n     - Source and destination nodes\\n     - Whether to use automatic or manual slot migration\\n\\n3. **Monitor Resharding Progress:**\\n   - Continuously check cluster state:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -c -h <any-node> cluster info\\n     ```\\n   - Ensure `cluster_slots_assigned` matches total (16384).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## D. Manage Nodes from 1-hop and 2-hop Info\\n- **1-hop info:** Data directly from a node (e.g., `cluster nodes`, `cluster slots`).\\n- **2-hop info:** Data about peer nodes obtained via gossip or cluster messages.\\n\\n**To manage nodes:**\\n- Use `cluster nodes` to identify node IDs, roles, and IPs.\\n- Use `cluster slots` to see slot ownership.\\n- For troubleshooting or reconfiguration, reconfigure nodes via scripts or commands, ensuring `debug` is enabled.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 3. Key Commands\\n| Action | Command | Description |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Add node | `redis-cli --cluster add-node <new-ip>:6379 <existing-ip>:6379` | Join new node to cluster |\\n| Check slots | `redis-cli --cluster check <node-ip>:6379` | Verify cluster state |\\n| Reshard | `redis-cli --cluster reshard <node-ip>:6379` | Rebalance keyslots |\\n| View cluster info | `redis-cli -c -h <node> cluster info` | Get cluster health/status |\\n| View nodes | `redis-cli -c -h <node> cluster nodes` | List nodes and roles |\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure `debug` command is enabled before reconfiguring nodes.\\n- **Caution:** Resharding can temporarily impact performance; plan during maintenance windows.\\n- **Cluster health:** Always verify `cluster_slots_fail` and `cluster_slots_pfail` are zero before and after scaling.\\n- **Failover readiness:** Confirm at least one keyslot exists on each shard to enable failover if needed.\\n- **2-hop info:** Use gossip and cluster messages to understand peer node states and topology, especially when troubleshooting or planning resharding.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis structured approach ensures a safe and effective scale-up process, leveraging both 1-hop and 2-hop cluster information for management and troubleshooting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      to scale up redis cluster and manage nodes, you need to create or recreate clusters from snapshots as described in the 1-hop context, and also perform scaling, upgrades, and maintenance activities outlined in the 2-hop context, such as geo patroni cluster management and managing redis cluster features, ensuring proper provisioning and management of redis nodes.      0.880435          0.725072                1.0        0.000000            0.514207               0.000000\n",

[primary fails (as determined by Sentinel), one of the replicas is promoted to primary.\\nClients are configured to connect to the sentinels which will then direct them to the current primary; there is no load\\nbalancer involved in this path. Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., ```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n1)  1) \"name\"\\n2) \"gstg-redis-cache\"        # cluster_id\\n3) \"ip\"\\n4) \"10.224.8.103\"            # ip address of the current master\\n5) \"port\"\\n6) \"6379\"\\n7) \"runid\"\\n8) \"06277f7abca059c268b2c5e2b2581d7d3bf330f1\"\\n9) \"flags\"\\n10) \"master\"\\n11) \"link-pending-commands\"\\n12) \"0\"\\n13) \"link-refcount\"\\n14) \"1\"\\n15) \"last-ping-sent\"\\n16) \"0\"\\n17) \"last-ok-ping-reply\"\\n18) \"440\"\\n19) \"last-ping-reply\"\\n20) \"440\"\\n21) \"down-after-milliseconds\"\\n22) \"10000\"\\n23) \"info-refresh\"\\n24) \"9021\"\\n25) \"role-reported\"\\n26) \"master\"\\n27) \"role-reported-time\"\\n28) \"956691745\"\\n29) \"config-epoch\"\\n30) \"51\"\\n31) \"num-slaves\"\\n32) \"2\"\\n33) \"num-other-sentinels\"\\n34) \"2\"\\n35) \"quorum\"\\n36) \"2\"\\n37) \"failover-timeout\"\\n38) \"60000\"\\n39) \"parallel-syncs\"\\n40) \"1\"\\n```\\n1.

[Section titled “Is redis running?”](#is-redis-running) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana) Grafana dashboards: - [redis](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-main/redis-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-cache](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sidekiq](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-tracechunks](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-tracechunks-main/redis-tracechunks-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-ratelimiting](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-ratelimiting-main/redis-ratelimiting-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sessions](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sessions-main/redis-sessions-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) For example, there is a Grafana chart showing number of slowlog events in redis-sidekiq (not linking it here because the panel ID changes when Grafana dashboards are deployed). ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos) <https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1w&g0.expr=redis_up%20%3C%201&g0.tab=0> ### directly on a redis host [Section titled “directly on a redis host”](#directly-on-a-redis-host) - is redis up? - `gitlab-ctl status` - can we dial redis? - `telnet localhost 6379` - can we talk to redis via `redis-cli`? ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info ``` ## How to get redis stats? [Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1) [see above](#grafana) ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1) Redis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` . It is scraped by Prometheus. See [the exporter documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) for more details. [Example `redis_exporter` metric](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=redis_commands_processed_total&g0.tab=1) in Thanos. ### redis-cli [Section titled “redis-cli”](#redis-cli) Run: - [INFO command](https://redis.io/commands/info) - [MEMORY\\_STATS command](https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats) NOTE: DO NOT USE [MONITOR] COMMAND! It streams back every command processed by the Redis server which can double the use of resources. It can overload a production machine making it unresponsive or causing an OOM kill. NOTE: DO NOT USE [KEYS] COMMAND! It will overload a production machine. ## What is causing Redis to slowdown? [Section titled “What is causing Redis to slowdown?”](#what-is-causing-redis-to-slowdown) The application relies on Redis throughput to be very high, latency spikes can be detrimental to the operation of the entire application. ### Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana”](#prometheusthanosgrafana) Explore Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana. Historical metrics might suggest a sudden change in the application behavior or traffic, for example: - operations rate, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=54> - keys rate of change, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=64> For Grafana links [see above](#grafana). ### slowlog [Section titled “slowlog”](#slowlog) The slowlog records slow Redis queries. Redis [SLOWLOG command documentation](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog). Get top 10 Redis slowlog entries: Terminal window ``` > slowlog get 10 1) 1) (integer) 5100 # A unique progressive identifier for every slow log entry. 2) (integer) 1561019091 # The unix timestamp at which the logged command was processed. 3) (integer) 21390 # The amount of time needed for its execution, in microseconds. 4) 1) \"del\" # The array composing the arguments of the command. 2) \"cache:gitlab:242234:8213877:Ci::CompareTestReportsService\" ``` To convert the timestamp, use `date -d @1561019091`. Get the command execution time threshold at which commands are logged (in microseconds): ``` > config get slowlog-log-slower-than ``` Get size of slowlog (entries are discarded like in a FIFO queue): ``` > config get slowlog-max-len ``` #### Monitoring number of slowlog entries [Section titled “Monitoring number of slowlog entries”](#monitoring-number-of-slowlog-entries) The number of entries added to the slowlog is exposed as a Prometheus metric and [there is a Grafana chart for it](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=48). #### Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog [Section titled “Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog”](#monitoring-the-rate-of-change-in-the-slowlog) A useful metric for monitoring potential slow-downs in Redis is measuring the rate of change in the `redis_slowlog_last_id`. This can be done by plotting (`changes(redis_slowlog_last_id[1h])`](../<https://prometheus.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1d&g0.expr=changes(redis_slowlog_last_id%5B1h%5D)&g0.tab=0>). ### Redis latency monitoring framework [Section titled “Redis latency monitoring framework”](#redis-latency-monitoring-framework) Redis provides a latency diagnostic tool: <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> You may need to enable it with `CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100`. From <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> : By default monitoring is disabled (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. However while the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well. #### LATENCY DOCTOR [Section titled “LATENCY DOCTOR”](#latency-doctor) Terminal window ``` > CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100 > LATENCY DOCTOR Dave, I have observed latency spikes in this Redis instance. You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave? 1. command: 5 latency spikes (average 300ms, mean deviation 120ms, period 73.40 sec). Worst all time event 500ms. I have a few advices for you: - Your current Slow Log configuration only logs events that are slower than your configured latency monitor threshold. Please use 'CONFIG, <2-hop>\\n\\npresented are an optimistic estimate, as redis will require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over. This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1> - Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example: Terminal window ``` $ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master 2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec') ``` #### Redis Sentinel [Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ### 1. Direct Answer\\nFailover and recovery procedures are essential troubleshooting tools because they help identify whether Redis slowdown or replication issues are caused by node failures, network partitions, or saturation-induced slowness. By intentionally triggering failovers or restoring nodes, SREs can observe how Redis and Sentinel behave under failure conditions, isolate problematic nodes, verify replication health, and determine if issues are related to specific nodes, network issues, or workload saturation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### A. Diagnosing Redis Slowdown Using Failover Procedures\\n1. **Check current Redis health:**\\n   - Use Grafana dashboards or `redis-cli info` to assess response times, memory usage, and slowlog events.\\n2. **Identify potential saturation or node unresponsiveness:**\\n   - Look for high latency, backlog in client queues, or frequent slowlog entries.\\n3. **Trigger a manual failover:**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n     ```\\n     Replace `<sentinel_port>` with the Sentinel port (e.g., 26379) and `<CLUSTER_NAME>` with your cluster name (e.g., `gprd-redis`).\\n4. **Observe the failover process:**\\n   - Monitor Sentinel logs (`/var/log/gitlab/sentinel/current`) for failover events.\\n   - Check if the new primary exhibits the same slowdown.\\n5. **Assess the impact:**\\n   - If the new primary is also slow, the issue may be workload saturation or network issues.\\n   - If the new primary performs normally, the original node was likely the cause.\\n\\n#### B. Testing Recovery and Replication\\n6. **Reintegrate the old primary:**\\n   - Once it comes back online, Sentinel will automatically reconfigure it as a replica.\\n7. **Monitor replication health:**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -p <redis_port> INFO replication\\n     ```\\n     to verify replication status and lag.\\n8. **Check for flapping or instability:**\\n   - Review Sentinel logs for frequent failovers or replication issues.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Trigger failover:**\\n  ```\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n  ```\\n- **Check Redis info:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <redis_port> INFO\\n  ```\\n- **Check replication status:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <redis_port> INFO replication\\n  ```\\n- **Check slowlog:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <redis_port> SLOWLOG GET\\n  ```\\n- **Adjust `client-output-buffer-limit` temporarily (if needed):**\\n  ```\\n  REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -a $REDISCLI_AUTH config set client-output-buffer-limit \"slave 4294967296 4294967296 0\"\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have access to Sentinel logs and permissions to run Redis CLI commands.\\n- **Caution:** Triggering failovers can temporarily disrupt service; perform during maintenance windows if possible.\\n- **Monitoring:** Always monitor Sentinel logs and Redis slowlogs during and after failover to identify persistent issues.\\n- **Workload considerations:** If saturation is suspected, analyze client request patterns and optimize or throttle high-impact operations.\\n- **Network issues:** Use `telnet` or `redis-cli info` directly on Redis hosts to verify connectivity and responsiveness.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:** Failover and recovery procedures allow SREs to simulate failure scenarios, observe Redis behavior, verify replication health, and isolate causes of slowdown or replication issues, thereby facilitating targeted troubleshooting and resolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Failover and recovery procedures are essential for addressing redis slowdown causes and replication issues by ensuring that Redis can quickly switch to a healthy master if the current one fails, and by restoring replication links. These procedures include building new Redis servers, starting replication with 'slaveof' commands, and using Sentinel to manage automatic failover. Properly executing these steps helps maintain high availability, reduces latency spikes, and resolves replication problems, thereby improving Redis performance and stability.      0.637500          0.878598                1.0        0.666667            0.415247               0.181818\n",

Former attempts are documented here: - [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256) - [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358) ## Setting up instances [Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances) First, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely: - `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd` - `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1` - `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag` - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`) - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag` - `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`. - `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) When configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application. E.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes. **Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand. ### 1. Generate Redis passwords [Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords) Generate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using: ``` for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done ``` Update both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master): ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV> ``` Update the JSON payload to include the new instance details: ``` { ..., \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"redis_conf\": { \"masteruser\": \"replica\", \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"user\": [ \"default off\", \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\", \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\", \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\" ] } } } ``` Do the same for ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV> ``` Modify the existing JSON ``` { \"redis_exporter\": { \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"env\": { \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\" } } } } ``` ### 2. Create Chef roles [Section titled “2. Create Chef roles”](#2-create-chef-roles) Set the new chef roles and add the new role to the list of gitlab-redis roles in -infra-prometheus-server role. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3494). ### 3. Provision VMs [Section titled “3. Provision VMs”](#3-provision-vms) Provision the VMs via the generic-stor/google terraform module. This is done in the [config-mgmt project in the ops environment](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/). An example MR can be found [here](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5811). After the MR is merged and applied, check the VM state via: ``` gcloud compute instances list --project <GCP_PROJECT> | grep 'redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>' ``` You need to wait for the initial chef-client run to complete. One way to check is to tail the serial port output to check when the initial run is completed. An example: ``` gcloud compute --project=<GCP_PROJECT> instances tail-serial-port-output redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV> --zone us-east1-{c/b/d} ``` ### 4. Initialising the cluster [Section titled “4. Initialising the cluster”](#4-initialising-the-cluster) a. SSH into one of the instance: ``` ssh redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV>.c.<GCP_PROJECT>.internal ``` b. Run the following: ``` export ENV=<ENV> export PROJECT=<GCP_PROJECT> export DEPLOYMENT=redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE> ``` c. Use the following command to connect the master-nodes and initialise a working cluster. Add more shard FQDN where necessary. e.g. `$DEPLOYMENT-shard-<shard_number>-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379`. ``` sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster create \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-02-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-03-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 ``` Use the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..m}` where `n` is the number of shards and `m` is the number of instances per shard. ``` for i in {01,02,03}-{02,03}; do sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 sleep 2 done ``` Use the following command, to assign the replicas within each shard. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..n}` where necessary depending on the cluster-size. ``` for i in {01,02,03}; do for j in {02,03}; do node_id=\"$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster nodes | grep $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal | awk '{ print $1 }')\"; sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-$j-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal \\ cluster replicate $node_id done done ``` ### 5.

Direct Answer:**  \\nHashicorp Vault is used to securely manage and store Redis cluster passwords, providing a centralized, encrypted secrets management system. It allows SREs to retrieve, rotate, and control access to Redis passwords dynamically, reducing the risk of credential leaks and simplifying secret lifecycle management.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Access Vault**  \\n- Log into Vault with appropriate permissions.  \\n- Use the Vault CLI or API to authenticate (e.g., via token, AppRole, or other methods).\\n\\n**Step 2: Retrieve Redis Password**  \\n- Locate the secret path where Redis credentials are stored, e.g., `secret/data/redis/cluster`.  \\n- Use the command:  \\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv get secret/redis/cluster\\n  ```  \\n- Extract the password from the returned data.\\n\\n**Step 3: Use the Password in Redis Configuration**  \\n- Update your Redis cluster configuration files or environment variables with the retrieved password.  \\n- Ensure your application or Redis client fetches the password dynamically at startup or as needed.\\n\\n**Step 4: Rotate Redis Passwords (if needed)**  \\n- Generate a new password securely (via Vault or your password generator).  \\n- Store the new password in Vault:  \\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv put secret/redis/cluster password=new_secure_password\\n  ```  \\n- Update Redis configuration to use the new password and reload/restart Redis if necessary.\\n\\n**Step 5: Manage Access Control**  \\n- Use Vault policies to restrict who can read or rotate Redis credentials.  \\n- Regularly audit access logs via Vault audit logs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands:**\\n\\n- Authenticate to Vault:  \\n  ```bash\\n  vault login <token>\\n  ```  \\n- Retrieve Redis credentials:  \\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv get secret/redis/cluster\\n  ```  \\n- Store new Redis password:  \\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv put secret/redis/cluster password=<new_password>\\n  ```  \\n- (Optional) Generate a random password:  \\n  ```bash\\n  openssl rand -base64 32\\n  ```  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure Vault is properly configured with the correct secrets engine (KV v2 or v1) and policies.  \\n- **Security:** Limit access to Vault secrets via policies; do not hardcode credentials.  \\n- **Automation:** Integrate secret retrieval into deployment scripts or configuration management tools for seamless updates.  \\n- **Rotation:** Regularly rotate passwords to enhance security, and ensure Redis instances are updated accordingly.  \\n- **Auditing:** Use Vault’s audit logging features to track secret access and modifications.  \\n\\nThis approach centralizes Redis password management, enhances security, and simplifies secret lifecycle handling for your Redis clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hashicorp Vault is used to generate and store Redis passwords, which are then updated in the vault secrets and used for configuring Redis cluster instances and related services.      0.000000          0.923218                0.0        0.666667            0.450075               0.000000\n",

Wait for the redis to configure itself as a replica and catch up with the primary.\\nMost of the required logic for doing so safely exists in the set of redis reconfigure scripts:\\n- [`omnibus-redis-reconfigure.sh`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/omnibus-redis-reconfigure.sh), [Section titled “Troubleshooting Pointers”](#troubleshooting-pointers)\\n- [A survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab](../redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres)\\n- [../redis/redis.md](../redis/redis)\\n## Summary\\n[Section titled “Summary”](#summary)\\nThe Sessions Redis instances are a distinct Redis used by Rails for web session storage/handling. Per-session storage is typically fairly small (hundreds of bytes), but there are a lot of them, they are touched a lot by active users, and some can be big either naturally or unexpectedly.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nRedis is deployed in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis.\\n## Scalability\\n[Section titled “Scalability”](#scalability)\\nSingle threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis, but at initial move we are anticipating something in the order of 20% absolute CPU usage. Data storage for sessions is in the order of 10GB (at end of 2021).\\n## Availability\\n[Section titled “Availability”](#availability)\\nThe usual redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\n## Durability\\n[Section titled “Durability”](#durability)\\nSession data is an interesting hybrid; we do *generally* want durability/persistence, but can tolerate some loss of data (generally a log-out for affected users). As such while we persist to disk with RDB, we also have maxmemory and an eviction policy (volatile-ttl) that will, if necessary, evict data with the shortest TTL remaining (sessions that were close to expiry anyway). Alerting is set to tell us if we are approaching that state of affairs, but that policy gives us space to mitigate/manage the situation without disaster.\\n## Monitoring/Alerting\\n[Section titled “Monitoring/Alerting”](#monitoringalerting)\\nGenerally the same as other Redis clusters, but with special handling for monitoring maximum memory (as a proportion of the configured limit, not the system limit), and alerting if redis\\_evicted\\_keys\\_total raises above zero (meaning we missed memory saturation)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis-sessions/README.md)\\n[Previous\\nRedis Registry Cache Service](/redis-registry-cache/)   [Next\\nRedis Sidekiq Service](/redis-sidekiq/), - [Replication issues](#replication-issues)\\n- [Switch Master manually](#switch-master-manually)\\n- [Replication flapping](#replication-flapping)\\n- [Redis is down](#redis-is-down)\\n- [Failed to collect Redis metrics](#failed-to-collect-redis-metrics)\\n- [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)\\n- [BigKeys analysis](#bigkeys-analysis)\\n- [References](#references)\\n# Troubleshooting\\n## Is redis running?\\n[Section titled “Is redis running?”](#is-redis-running)\\n### Grafana\\n[Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana)\\nGrafana dashboards:\\n- [redis](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-main/redis-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-cache](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-sidekiq](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-tracechunks](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-tracechunks-main/redis-tracechunks-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-ratelimiting](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-ratelimiting-main/redis-ratelimiting-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- [redis-sessions](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sessions-main/redis-sessions-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now)\\nFor example, there is a Grafana chart showing number of slowlog events in redis-sidekiq (not linking it here because the panel ID changes when Grafana dashboards are deployed).\\n### Prometheus/Thanos\\n[Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos)\\n<https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1w&g0.expr=redis_up%20%3C%201&g0.tab=0>\\n### directly on a redis host\\n[Section titled “directly on a redis host”](#directly-on-a-redis-host)\\n- is redis up?\\n- `gitlab-ctl status`\\n- can we dial redis?\\n- `telnet localhost 6379`\\n- can we talk to redis via `redis-cli`?\\n```\\nREDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info\\n```\\n## How to get redis stats?\\n[Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats)\\n### Grafana\\n[Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1)\\n[see above](#grafana)\\n### Prometheus/Thanos\\n[Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1)\\nRedis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` .

NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial>\\nFrom time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes.\\nSo, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take:\\n1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`\\n- This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel\\n2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel`\\n- Not sure why, but it’s minor\\n3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master:\\n1.

So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status.\\nIt’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time.\\n### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)\\n[Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses

Verification of config in a VM [Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm) Check the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference. ``` [ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME> => \"PONG\" [ gstg ] production> ``` ### 3. Configure Gitlab Rails [Section titled “3. Configure Gitlab Rails”](#3-configure-gitlab-rails) a. Update secret ``` vault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED> ``` For example, ``` vault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails ======================== Secret Path ======================== k8s/data/env/gprd/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-rails ======= Metadata ======= Key Value --- ----- created_time 2023-03-18T00:33:29.790293426Z custom_metadata <nil> deletion_time n/a destroyed false version 1 ====== Data ====== Key Value --- ----- password <RAILS_REDACTED> ``` Note the version of the password in `vault kv get` and make sure it tallies with the external secret definition in [k8s-workload](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/master/releases/gitlab-external-secrets/values/values.yaml.gotmpl): ``` gitlab-redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails-credential-v1: refreshInterval: 0 secretStoreName: gitlab-secrets target: creationPolicy: Owner deletionPolicy: Delete data: - remoteRef: key: env/{{ $env }}/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails property: password version: \"1\" secretKey: password ``` Note that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets). b. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly. Either add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`.

Redis is managed via dedicated Chef cookbooks (`gitlab-redis`, `gitlab-redis-cluster`, and `omnibus-gitlab`) and configuration is handled through these tools and associated scripts, not through GitLab itself.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n1. **Identify the Configuration Management System:**  \\n   - Redis deployments are managed by Chef cookbooks (`gitlab-redis`, `gitlab-redis-cluster`, `omnibus-gitlab`) as documented in the runbook.\\n\\n2. **Check the Relevant Documentation:**  \\n   - Review the [Redis Overview section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/README.md#overview) which states that Redis is managed via these cookbooks.\\n\\n3. **Verify the Configuration Files and Scripts:**  \\n   - Redis configuration files (`redis.conf`) are generated and managed by Chef and Omnibus, not GitLab.\\n   - The reconfiguration process involves scripts like [`omnibus-redis-reconfigure.sh`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/omnibus-redis-reconfigure.sh).\\n\\n4. **Understand the Deployment Process:**  \\n   - Patching, failover, and reconfiguration are performed through Chef and scripts, not through GitLab interface or GitLab-managed configurations.\\n\\n5. **Additional Context:**  \\n   - The runbook explicitly mentions that GitLab's code repository (via GitLab.com) hosts runbooks and scripts, but not the Redis configuration management itself.\\n   - Redis is configured and maintained through Chef cookbooks and scripts, with no indication of GitLab being used as a configuration source.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Commands and Configuration Context:**\\n\\n- To reconfigure Redis after changes:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure\\n  ```\\n- To start Sentinel (if needed):\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel\\n  ```\\n- To manually set up replication:\\n  ```bash\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli\\n  # then run:\\n  slaveof MASTER_IP 6379\\n  ```\\n- To check Redis status:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl status\\n  redis-cli info\\n  ```\\n\\n**Important Notes:**\\n\\n- Redis configuration is automated via Chef cookbooks and scripts, not via GitLab.\\n- Changes to Redis configurations are performed through reconfiguration scripts and Chef, ensuring consistency across deployments.\\n- Always follow the documented procedures for reconfiguration and failover, avoiding manual edits to configuration files unless explicitly instructed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nGitLab serves as the platform hosting runbooks, scripts, and documentation, but it is not used directly for managing Redis configurations. Redis is managed through Chef cookbooks and scripts as part of the infrastructure automation process.

Per-session storage is typically fairly small (hundreds of bytes), but there are a lot of them, they are touched a lot by active users, and some can be big either naturally or unexpectedly.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nRedis is deployed in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis.\\n## Scalability\\n[Section titled “Scalability”](#scalability)\\nSingle threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis, but at initial move we are anticipating something in the order of 20% absolute CPU usage. Data storage for sessions is in the order of 10GB (at end of 2021).\\n## Availability\\n[Section titled “Availability”](#availability)\\nThe usual redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\n## Durability\\n[Section titled “Durability”](#durability)\\nSession data is an interesting hybrid; we do *generally* want durability/persistence, but can tolerate some loss of data (generally a log-out for affected users). As such while we persist to disk with RDB, we also have maxmemory and an eviction policy (volatile-ttl) that will, if necessary, evict data with the shortest TTL remaining (sessions that were close to expiry anyway). Alerting is set to tell us if we are approaching that state of affairs, but that policy gives us space to mitigate/manage the situation without disaster.\\n## Monitoring/Alerting\\n[Section titled “Monitoring/Alerting”](#monitoringalerting)\\nGenerally the same as other Redis clusters, but with special handling for monitoring maximum memory (as a proportion of the configured limit, not the system limit), and alerting if redis\\_evicted\\_keys\\_total raises above zero (meaning we missed memory saturation)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis-sessions/README.md)\\n[Previous\\nRedis Registry Cache Service](/redis-registry-cache/)   [Next\\nRedis Sidekiq Service](/redis-sidekiq/), - [Network partition](#network-partition)\\n- [Persistence Guarantees](#persistence-guarantees)\\n- [What do we store?](#what-do-we-store)\\n- [Clients](#clients)\\n- [What about redis cluster?](#what-about-redis-cluster)\\n- [Maintanence](#maintanence)\\n- [Reconfigure](#reconfigure)\\n- [Debugging and Diagnosis](#debugging-and-diagnosis)\\n- [Identifying the primary](#identifying-the-primary)\\n- [Basic stats](#basic-stats)\\n- [Slowlogs](#slowlogs)\\n- [ElasticSearch analysis](#elasticsearch-analysis)\\n- [Monitor commands](#monitor-commands)\\n- [Flamegraphs](#flamegraphs)\\n- [Bigkeys](#bigkeys)\\n# A survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab\\nSee also <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/redis.html> which covers some of the same\\nground, but with a developer orientation and the SRE-oriented [runbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md)\\n## What is Redis\\n[Section titled “What is Redis”](#what-is-redis)\\nRedis is a fast in-memory key-value store. It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability).

Sometimes we have incidents like\\n[#5478](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/5478) where we end up with invalid data in the cache, and no convenient way to\\nclear it. This document describes an approach for deleting a specified set of\\ncache keys on GitLab.com without consuming excessive Redis resources.\\nThis approach is split into two phases:\\n1. Obtain the keys to be deleted (against a secondary)\\n2. Delete the specified keys (against the primary)\\nBy doing this, we gain a few benefits:\\n1. We perform as few operations on the primary as necessary. Secondaries do not\\nreceive application traffic, and so have more headroom and can tolerate being\\nblocked briefly.\\n2. We can retain a list of deleted keys for later inspection - for instance, if\\na user reports an issue, we can check if their cache key was in the list.\\n3. Obtaining the keys to be deleted may be an iterative, exploratory process. We\\ndo not want to conflate this with data deletion, which should ideally be as\\nsimple as possible.\\n(In the future we may move to having [version-based cache invalidation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9815), where\\nthis will be simpler. One example is the way it’s possible to [invalidate the\\nMarkdown cache](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/invalidate_markdown_cache.html) - which is in Postgres, not Redis - via the API.)\\n## Step 1: obtain the keys to be deleted\\n[Section titled “Step 1: obtain the keys to be deleted”](#step-1-obtain-the-keys-to-be-deleted)\\n**On a secondary**, we can run a Ruby script like the below. `REDIS_PASSWORD` is\\nprovided as an environment variable.

Direct Answer:**\\nAn SSL Certificate is a digital credential used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between a client (like a web browser) and a server (such as Redis or a web server). It verifies the identity of the server and enables encrypted communication to protect data in transit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook and general knowledge):**\\n\\n**Step 1: Understand the Purpose of SSL Certificates**\\n- SSL Certificates enable encrypted communication and verify server identity.\\n- They are essential for securing data exchanged over networks, especially for sensitive information.\\n\\n**Step 2: Obtain an SSL Certificate**\\n- Generate a private key and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).\\n- Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA) to get a signed SSL certificate.\\n- Alternatively, generate a self-signed certificate for internal or testing purposes.\\n\\n**Step 3: Install the SSL Certificate on Redis or Web Server**\\n- Place the certificate and private key files on the server hosting Redis or the web service.\\n- Configure the server to use SSL/TLS by specifying the certificate and key paths.\\n\\n**Step 4: Configure Redis to Use SSL (if applicable)**\\n- Redis does not natively support SSL; use stunnel or a proxy to add SSL encryption.\\n- Configure stunnel with the SSL certificate and key, and point it to Redis.\\n- Update Redis client configurations to connect via the SSL-enabled proxy.\\n\\n**Step 5: Verify SSL Setup**\\n- Use tools like `openssl s_client -connect <host>:<port>` to test the SSL connection.\\n- Check that the certificate is valid and the connection is encrypted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands and Configurations:**\\n\\n- **Generating a CSR and private key:**\\n  ```bash\\n  openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout redis.key -out redis.csr\\n  ```\\n- **Installing SSL certificate files:**\\n  - Place `fullchain.pem` (certificate) and `privkey.pem` (private key) on the server.\\n- **Configuring stunnel (example):**\\n  ```ini\\n  [redis]\\n  accept = 6379\\n  connect = 127.0.0.1:6379\\n  cert = /path/to/fullchain.pem\\n  key = /path/to/privkey.pem\\n  ```\\n- **Connecting with redis-cli via SSL (using stunnel or proxy):**\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -h <host> -p 6380 --tls --cert /path/to/cert.pem --key /path/to/key.pem --cacert /path/to/ca.pem\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n- Redis does not natively support SSL; use stunnel or a similar proxy.\\n- Ensure the SSL certificate is valid and trusted by clients.\\n- For production, always use certificates signed by a trusted CA.\\n- Regularly renew and update certificates before expiration.\\n- Verify SSL configuration with testing tools to ensure secure setup.\\n- Proper permissions and security practices should be followed when handling private keys.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\nAn SSL Certificate is crucial for securing Redis communications. The process involves obtaining, installing, and configuring the certificate, often with an SSL proxy like stunnel, and verifying the setup to ensure encrypted, trusted connections.

Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Why partition?](#why-partition)\\n- [Timing](#timing)\\n- [Determining what to split off](#determining-what-to-split-off)\\n- [Implementation](#implementation)\\n- [Application changes](#application-changes)\\n- [Infrastructure changes](#infrastructure-changes)\\n- [VMs](#vms)\\n- [K8s](#k8s)\\n- [Redis-cluster](#redis-cluster)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Migration process](#migration-process)\\n- [Verification](#verification)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Why partition?](#why-partition)\\n- [Timing](#timing)\\n- [Determining what to split off](#determining-what-to-split-off)\\n- [Implementation](#implementation)\\n- [Application changes](#application-changes)\\n- [Infrastructure changes](#infrastructure-changes)\\n- [VMs](#vms)\\n- [K8s](#k8s)\\n- [Redis-cluster](#redis-cluster)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Migration process](#migration-process)\\n- [Verification](#verification)\\n# Functional Partitioning\\n## Why partition?\\n[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition)\\nRedis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done.\\nIn the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well.\\nThe other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system.\\n## Timing\\n[Section titled “Timing”](#timing), replication resynchronization). If all 3 nodes fail at once, the entire cache will be wiped; this is not ideal but\\nacceptable as it will be refilled on demand. For ratelimiting, the data has only short term usefulness anyway (generally\\n1 minute, with some up to 3 minutes) so complete loss is not significant.\\n## What do we store?\\n[Section titled “What do we store?”](#what-do-we-store)\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/419> contains some summary analysis of the keyspace across\\nthe persistent and cache instances, as at July 2020. This will change over time as the code base evolves, but the link\\nprovides some indication what we’re storing (it’s not as wide a range of things as you might expect in the\\npersistent instance).\\nThe data stored in the sidekiq instances is not really under our control (it’s whatever sidekiq needs to do its job).\\nSome details on that are available in [Sidekiq Survival Guide for SREs](../../sidekiq/sidekiq-survival-guide-for-sres).\\nThe data in the tracechunks instance is exclusively the output of CI jobs on its way into Object Storage (received by\\nand API request, written into Redis, and a Sidekiq job immediately scheduled to asynchronously write it to Object Storage);\\nwhile important, it is also extremely transient, and under normal circumstances there should be no significant build up\\nof data in this instance. Any such build up implies a problem (Sidekiq not processing, perhaps?) and so we have\\nparticularly low alert thresholds for memory saturation on this instance. At the time we chose to split this instance\\nfrom the primary persistent (shared state) instance (mid 2021), CI trace chunks were responsible for roughly 60% of the\\ndata throughput into/out of the shared state redis, and 16% of Redis calls.\\nThe data in the ratelimiting instance is a set of keys identifying actors (typically users, IP addresses, or in some\\ncases projects) and activities, with the value being the count of usage in the current period (the period is also encoded\\ninto the key name). TTLs are used to expire these automatically so there’s no manual cleanup by clients, it is automatic\\nand internal to Redis.\\nThe data in the sessions instance is exclusively that related to web sessions.\\n## Clients\\n[Section titled “Clients”](#clients)\\nMost of the clients are Ruby, specifically Rails code on the web, api, git, and sidekiq nodes. Workhorse (in Go) also\\n[uses](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/blob/master/README.md#redis) Redis to do long polling for CI build requests.\\nRails uses the generic [connection\\_pool](https://github.com/mperham/connection_pool) to maintain long running connections\\nwhich are used by threads/workers as necessary, which is particularly important as redis is typically expected to be\\nvery fast and low latency.\\nSee [High Availability](#high-availability) for some comments regarding connections via sentinels.\\n## What about redis cluster?\\n[Section titled “What about redis cluster?”](#what-about-redis-cluster)\\n[Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec) is a Redis feature that lets you horizontally shard data across\\nmultiple machines. If any one of our Redis clusters grows too large to fit in memory on a single machine or such that\\nthe single-threaded CPU becomes a hard limit, then Redis Cluster is a possible mitigation. Manually sharding the data\\nis an alternative approach, e.g. having more than one cache cluster and dividing the types of keys up in some way using\\napplication controlled logic, or splitting the sidekiq processing onto multiple clusters. Neither option is low effort.\\nSee the [Redis Cluster documentation for more details](../../redis/redis-cluster).\\nSee:\\n1. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9788>\\n2. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/305>\\n## Maintanence\\n[Section titled “Maintanence”](#maintanence)\\n### Reconfigure\\n[Section titled “Reconfigure”](#reconfigure)\\nIn order to apply config changes, we need to run a `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.

This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1>\\n- Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example:\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n$ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master\\n2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec')\\n```\\n#### Redis Sentinel\\n[Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel)\\nNOTE: At the moment of writing, Redis Cluster is not used anywhere in the gitlab.com infrastructure, we only utilize Redis Sentinel.\\nRedis Sentinel provides compatible clients with a pointer to the current Redis primary. Clients will query Sentinel and then connect directly to the primary Redis (in other words, Sentinel does not proxy requests).\\nAdditionally, Sentinel will reconfigure Redis instances as primary or secondaries, depending on the Sentinel clusters quorum.\\nFor more information see [Sentinel documentation](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel)\\nSentinel is configured via `gitlab.rb`:\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n$ sudo grep redis_sentinels /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb\\ngitlab_rails['redis_sentinels'] = [{\"host\"=>\"10.66.2.101\", \"port\"=>26379}, {\"host\"=>\"10.66.2.102\", \"port\"=>26379}, {\"host\"=>\"10.66.2.103\", \"port\"=>26379}]\\n```\\nwhich gets translated into `/var/opt/gitlab/sentinel/sentinel.conf`.\\n##### Get Redis master\\n[Section titled “Get Redis master”](#get-redis-master)\\nOnce you have the IP of a sentinel, use `redis-cli` to access sentinel. Sentinel usually runs on port `26379` (ie, Redis port (`6379`) + `20000`). The `sentinel masters` command will return a list of Redis primaries managed by this sentinel cluster:\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -h 10.66.2.101 -p 26379 sentinel

“Logging”](#logging) - [system](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/a10c2cd2b710f9eb65b13b9a2a328d51) The TraceChunks redis instances is a distinct redis cluster for storing CI build trace chunks immediately when received by the API from runners, before they are asynchronously (Ci::BuildTraceChunkFlushWorker) moved from there to ObjectStorage (as configured in .com; the database is another target option, but we don’t do that anymore). The data is important and persistent but transient (seconds to 10s of seconds normally, probably not minutes, definitely not hours, unless something has gone horribly wrong). This was split because as found in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327469#note_556531587> these trace chunks were (at the time) responsible for about 60% of the network throughput by bytes on the persistent redis, and 16% of the Redis calls, and it is a distinctive enough workload/usage pattern that splitting it out was deemed a good thing. Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters) Single threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then) The usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> ) Data is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable. Uses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover from. -]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   **1. Direct Answer:**  \\nGitLab.com is the hosted version of GitLab, a web-based platform for version control, CI/CD, and collaboration. It provides source code management, issue tracking, continuous integration, and other DevOps tools, all managed and maintained by GitLab Inc.  \\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook Documentation):**  \\nWhile the runbook primarily details Redis Sentinel and cluster management procedures, understanding \"gitlab.com\" in this context relates to the overall infrastructure that includes Redis clusters supporting GitLab services. Here’s how it fits in:  \\n\\n**a. Infrastructure Context:**  \\n- GitLab.com relies on Redis for caching, rate limiting, sessions, and other features.  \\n- Redis clusters are managed with Sentinel for high availability, automatic failover, and monitoring.  \\n- The runbook explains how Sentinel detects failures, promotes replicas, and maintains Redis availability, ensuring GitLab.com remains operational.  \\n\\n**b. Redis Failover and Monitoring:**  \\n- Sentinel monitors Redis nodes; if the primary fails, it promotes a replica to primary.  \\n- Clients (like GitLab services) connect via Sentinel, which directs them to the current primary.  \\n- Regular checks and reconfiguration procedures ensure Redis health, indirectly supporting GitLab.com’s uptime.  \\n\\n**c. Maintenance and Troubleshooting:**  \\n- Use Sentinel commands to identify the current Redis master, check replication lag, and verify cluster health.  \\n- Reconfigure Redis as needed with `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` during maintenance windows.  \\n- Monitor Redis metrics via Prometheus dashboards to ensure performance stability for GitLab.com.  \\n\\n**3. Key Commands and Configurations:**  \\n- To identify the current Redis master:  \\n```bash\\n/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -h <sentinel_host> -p 26379 sentinel masters\\n```  \\n- To check Redis configuration limits:  \\n```bash\\nredis-cli CONFIG GET client-output-buffer-limit\\n```  \\n- To verify Sentinel configuration:  \\n```bash\\nsudo grep redis_sentinels /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb\\n```  \\n- To reconfigure Redis after changes:  \\n```bash\\nsudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure\\n```  \\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**  \\n- No load balancer is involved; clients connect directly via Sentinel, which manages failover transparently.  \\n- Sentinel health checks depend on Redis responsiveness; slowness can trigger unintended failovers.  \\n- Always verify Sentinel and Redis health before making configuration changes.  \\n- In case of node failures, follow the runbook procedures to check Sentinel status, identify the master, and ensure proper failover.  \\n- Be aware that if all nodes fail simultaneously, GitLab.com will be down until recovery.  \\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nGitLab.com is the hosted platform that depends on a resilient Redis infrastructure managed via Sentinel.

It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability).

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n# Redis Cluster\\n## Core concepts\\n[Section titled “Core concepts”](#core-concepts)\\nRedis Cluster is a mode of Redis to enable horizontal scaling. The dataset is divided among multiple nodes, allowing the computational load to be distributed.\\nHow does Redis Cluster differ from non-clustered Sentinel-based Redis instances?, Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters)\\nSingle threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then)\\nThe usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\nData is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable.\\nUses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover

[Section titled “Logging”](#logging) - system The Chat Cache Redis Cluster instances is a distinct Redis Cluster used by the GitLab Rails [chat features](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410521). Redis is in a 3-node-per-shard (single-primary/two-replica per shard) VM configuration, in cluster mode. The node count will start off at 3 but will increase as we scale horizontally. Uses the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters.

Direct Answer:**\\n\\nConnecting to various services via Teleport allows SREs to securely access Redis, PostgreSQL, and Patroni clusters through a unified, authenticated, and encrypted tunnel. This simplifies multi-service management by providing seamless, role-based access to different infrastructure components, enabling efficient troubleshooting, configuration, and maintenance without exposing direct network endpoints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n**A. Accessing Redis, PostgreSQL, and Patroni via Teleport**\\n\\n1. **Ensure Teleport is Installed and Configured:**\\n   - Confirm that Teleport client (`tsh`) is installed on your workstation.\\n   - Verify your user has appropriate roles and permissions to access the desired services.\\n\\n2. **Authenticate with Teleport:**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     tsh login --proxy=<teleport-proxy-host> --user=<your-username>\\n     ```\\n   - Enter your credentials when prompted.\\n   - This establishes your identity and grants access based on assigned roles.\\n\\n3. **List Available Services:**\\n   - To see accessible services:\\n     ```\\n     tsh ls\\n     ```\\n   - Look for entries like `redis`, `postgres`, or `patroni`.\\n\\n4. **Connect to Redis:**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy redis\\n     ```\\n   - Or, for specific Redis instances:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy redis --cluster\\n     ```\\n   - This creates a local port forwarding (e.g., localhost:6379) to the Redis service.\\n\\n5. **Connect to PostgreSQL:**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy postgres\\n     ```\\n   - Or specify a particular database:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy postgres --db=<database-name>\\n     ```\\n\\n6. **Connect to Patroni (PostgreSQL HA management):**\\n   - Use:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy patroni\\n     ```\\n   - This provides access to the Patroni API endpoints for cluster management.\\n\\n**B. Managing Multi-Service Access**\\n\\n- Once connected via Teleport, SREs can run Redis CLI (`redis-cli`), psql, or Patroni API commands locally, which are securely tunneled to the respective services.\\n- For example, to run Redis commands:\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379\\n  ```\\n- For PostgreSQL:\\n  ```\\n  psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U <user> <database>\\n  ```\\n- For Patroni, use API calls or `curl` commands to the local forwarded port.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands:**\\n\\n- **Login to Teleport:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh login --proxy=<proxy-host> --user=<username>\\n  ```\\n- **List available services:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh ls\\n  ```\\n- **Create port-forward to Redis:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh proxy redis\\n  ```\\n- **Create port-forward to PostgreSQL:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh proxy postgres\\n  ```\\n- **Access Redis CLI:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379\\n  ```\\n- **Access PostgreSQL:**\\n  ```\\n  psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U <user> <database>\\n  ```\\n- **Access Patroni API:**\\n  ```\\n  curl http://localhost:8008/cluster\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n\\n- **Security:** Teleport ensures encrypted, role-based access, reducing the risk of exposing direct network endpoints.\\n- **Permissions:** Ensure your Teleport roles include access to the specific services.\\n- **Session Management:** You can open multiple tunnels for different services simultaneously.\\n- **Limitations:** Some commands may require specific environment variables or configurations; consult the runbook for service-specific nuances.\\n- **Prerequisites:** Teleport must be properly configured with the correct roles and access policies aligned with your infrastructure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nUsing Teleport streamlines multi-service management by providing secure, unified access to Redis, PostgreSQL, and Patroni clusters. This approach enhances operational efficiency, security, and troubleshooting capabilities for SREs managing complex Redis infrastructure alongside other critical services.  Connecting to various services via Teleport enables secure and streamlined access to multiple infrastructure components, including PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters, by providing centralized authentication and access management. This facilitates troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintenance of these clusters within complex setups. In the context of Redis infrastructure, Teleport's ability to connect to diverse services ensures that engineers can efficiently manage Redis databases alongside PostgreSQL and Patroni, supporting high availability and performance. By enabling multi-service access through a unified platform, Teleport simplifies multi-hop workflows, allowing engineers to perform multi-layered operations—such as connecting to Redis clusters, then accessing PostgreSQL or Patroni clusters—without compromising security or efficiency.      0.560000          0.805163                0.0        1.000000            0.955341               0.200000\n",
      "5  How do migration procedures for Redis sharding, including cluster setup and reconfiguration, relate to handling Redis failover events and master switch logs in ensuring high availability and performance?

The dataset is divided among multiple nodes, allowing the computational load to be distributed.\\nHow does Redis Cluster differ from non-clustered Sentinel-based Redis instances?\\nPropertySentinelClusterDatasetEvery node has the entire datasetDistributed over `n` nodesComputationPerformed by master nodePerformed by respective hash slot ownerOperationsAll standard operations allowedCross-slot operations are not permittedScalabilityOnly vertical scalingIncrease cluster’s shard sizeFailoversCoordinated by SentinelsCoordinated by a quorum of master nodes\\nReferences\\n- [Redis Cluster Specifications](https://redis.io/docs/reference/cluster-spec/)\\n- [Redis Cluster Scaling](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/)\\n## Glossary\\n[Section titled “Glossary”](#glossary)\\n**cluster**: A set of Redis nodes running in cluster-enabled mode. In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., cluster_slots_pfail:0\\ncluster_slots_fail:0\\ncluster_known_nodes:12\\ncluster_size:4\\n```\\n## Enable `debug` command on Redis Cluster\\n[Section titled “Enable debug command on Redis Cluster”](#enable-debug-command-on-redis-cluster)\\nAs mentioned in the beginning, most of the existing Redis Clusters do not have `debug` command enabled, which is needed to fix the cluster state as part of troubleshooting broken cluster.\\nThis step will enable the `debug` command by reconfiguring the existing Redis processes. Previous CR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18043).\\nRun this from chef-repo, to find the existing Redis servers and reconfigure them via `redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh` in the runbooks repository, excluding new shard as it was configured already with `enable-debug-command` above during provisioning.\\nCaution\\n`enable-debug-command` config option must already be enabled for newly added nodes during the time of provisioning otherwise failover wouldn’t work, which is required for reconfiguring the Redis process. Failover requires at least one keyslot to be present on the shard.\\nCaution\\nBefore running `scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh`, check the content of `$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt` for any `knife` logs, remove such lines if any.\\n```\\n# cd chef-repo\\nknife search -i \"roles:$ENV-base-db-$DEPLOYMENT\" | sort -V | grep -v $SHARD_NUMBER > /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n# cd runbooks\\nscripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n```\\n## Scale out cluster by resharding Redis keys\\n[Section titled “Scale out cluster by resharding Redis keys”](#scale-out-cluster-by-resharding-redis-keys)\\nThe goal here is to distribute the number of keyslots among all shards equally (With some rounding off). By default, we have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster. Until now, we just added Redis instances for new shard to the cluster, but they do not have any Redis keys (keyslots) yet and hence they are not serving any user requests.\\nIn this phase, we will migrate some keyslots from previous Redis shards to the new shard, so that new Redis instances start load sharing with existing Redis instances and hence lower their resource (CPU/Memory) utilization. Previous CR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18061).\\n### 1. Check the current keyslot assignments\\n[Section titled “1. Check the current keyslot assignments”](#1-check-the-current-keyslot-assignments)\\nGet the existing keyslot assignments and node IDs of the master nodes in the cluster, to prepare the commands required for migrating the keyslots.\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n```\\nFor example:\\n```\\n$ sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n1) 1) (integer) 0\\n2) (integer) 5460\\n3) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\"\\n2) (integer) 6379\\n3) \"9b0828e3379a06dc5bb749a106ab2cad9e47e4e4\"\\n4) 1) \"ip\"\\n2) \"10.217.21.10\"\\n4) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-03-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\"\\n2) (integer) 6379\\n3) \"f70faccea8b3dfc3ce4cdecfaa23b5dfb0ed06b8\"\\n4) 1) \"ip\"\\n2) \"10.217.21.5\"\\n5) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-02-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\"\\n2) (integer) 6379\\n3) \"3627d1e0b5962218a29eb852716fb23e5cb71265\"\\n4) 1) \"ip\"\\n2) \"10.217.21.8\"\\n2) 1) (integer) 5461\\n2) (integer) 10922\\n3) 1) \"redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-02-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\", ```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot.

Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.\\n**resharding**: Migrating ownership of some hash slots from one shard to another. This is a dynamic online operation, where Redis keys are migrated between nodes. During a resharding operation, reads and writes to the keys being migrated are semantically safe but incur some extra overhead. Also, multi-key requests may temporarily fail during the transitional state. There are some documented corner cases where a failed resharding attempt must be manually completed. In our environments, because we do not intend to dynamically add/remove nodes, resharding will be a rare and planned event (e.g. when adding new nodes to the cluster for additional capacity), not a frequent automated background activity.\\nreplica migration - an optional feature that allows the cluster to dynamically reassign a replica from one master to another, to ensure all masters have at least N replicas. This feature aims to improve availability. However, it can counter-intuitively harm availability in either of 2 ways: it can lead to a master and its replicas being in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140700451)), or it can lead to accumulating a majority of masters in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140436657)). This feature can be disabled ([cluster-allow-replica-migration](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1662-L1668)) or tuned ([cluster-migration-barrier](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1642-L1660)). This is one of the topics to be addressed by scalability#2071.\\n## Observability\\n[Section titled “Observability”](#observability)\\nFor most parts, the Grafana dashboard is the same as a Sentinel-based Redis dashboard. The difference lies in:\\n1. Cluster-specific panel: This panel tracks the slot coverage and state of nodes in the cluster.

Redirections should only happen on (1) failover (requests are redirected to the new master), (2) resharding (requests are redirected to the new slot owner).\\nCross-slot errors are prevented on the application side and should not reach the servers except for pipelined operations during resharding. The volume can be tracked on logs under 2 groups of fields:\\n1. `json.redis_<functional shard>_allowed_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of [allowed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/92312944bb8a827b5d00509a5d07d0fe8ee4955d/lib/gitlab/instrumentation/redis_cluster_validator.rb#L205) cross-slot calls (i.e. commands are accounted for and are running on non-cluster-based Redis)\\n2. `json.redis_<functional_shard>_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of cross-slot commands (not accounted for or running on Redis Cluster)\\n## Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “Troubleshooting”](#troubleshooting)\\n### What is the state of the cluster?\\n[Section titled “What is the state of the cluster?”](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\nSome commands to understand the overall state:, ```\\n`CLUSTER INFO` gives a fast overview of the state.

See the [originating issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2140) for more information.\\nIn the event where the sidecar processes are not working, the SRE/EOC will need to run the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](https://redis.io/commands/cluster-failover/) command on the desired slave node to promote that node into a master.\\nRun the following command on the desired

datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over.

[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition) Redis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done. In the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well. The other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system. ## Timing [Section titled “Timing”](#timing) The last two redis partitions that we have done took between 3 - 6 weeks to complete. The main factors that slow down or speed up the time required are the availability of reviewers for MRs, particularly for the application changes. In general, tamland forecasts capacity out approximately three months, which should give us adequate time to partition if required. ## Determining what to split off [Section titled “Determining what to split off”](#determining-what-to-split-off) This is more of an art than a science, as it will require some amount of knowledge of the usage patterns of the redis in question. We have documented how to [analyze memory usage](../redis#redis-memory-analyzer) as well as [keyspace usage and network traffic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md#keyspace-pattern-analysis), all of which can be combined to help determine what the largest chunk that makes logical sense to move is. ## Implementation [Section titled “Implementation”](#implementation) A lot of these processes are still a work in progress and will be modified based off of the results of [the epic to lessen sharding toil](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/886). ## Application changes [Section titled “Application changes”](#application-changes) - Create a new redis store class. It should inherit from `Gitlab::Redis::Wrapper`. Configure its `config_fallback` to be the current store from which you’re sharding off this workload. - Add `use_primary_and_secondary_stores_for_<store_name>` and `use_primary_store_as_default_for_<store_name>` feature flags, matching the name of the new store. - Update the relevant client code to use the new store. [Example issue and MRs.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2149) ## Infrastructure changes [Section titled “Infrastructure changes”](#infrastructure-changes) With the [current k8s overhead due to the networking stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/16871), we can only migrate workloads that are expected to remain well under saturation threshold to Kubernetes. [See discussion points here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2130). This means that in most cases, we’ll likely be functionally sharding off onto VMs, but I’ve included the k8s documentation for when we can shift to using that more. We presently do not have a well known method of creating a redis cluster shard, but that is work in progress as well. ### VMs [Section titled “VMs”](#vms) 1. [Create a chef role](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/blob/master/roles/gprd-base-db-redis-server-db-load-balancing.json) 2. [Provision in terraform](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5009) 3. [Configure with redis-reconfigure.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/redis-reconfigure.sh) Step 1 and 2 will leave the cluster in a strange state, with each redis host believing they are the primary and a somewhat confused sentinel quorum. In order to get things back in order, you’ll need to run chef-client, gitlab-ctl reconfigure, and set each secondary to be a replica of the primary. The redis-reconfigure.sh script does this for you. Terminal]  ### 1. Direct Answer\\nMigration procedures for Redis sharding, including cluster setup and reconfiguration, are integral to maintaining high availability and performance, especially during failover events. Proper cluster setup ensures that data is evenly distributed and resilient to node failures. Reconfiguration (like resharding) allows dynamic redistribution of hash slots to balance load. Handling failover events—such as promoting replicas to masters—relies on cluster awareness and failover mechanisms, which are documented procedures. Reconfigurations and failover handling work together to ensure continuous data availability, minimal downtime, and optimal performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### A. Cluster Setup & Initialization\\n1. **Create a new Redis Cluster:**\\n   - Follow the [official Redis guide](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/#create-a-redis-cluster).\\n   - Use `redis-cli --cluster create` with the list of nodes and options.\\n2. **Configure nodes with `enable-debug-command`:**\\n   - Reconfigure existing nodes to enable `debug` commands:\\n     - Run `scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh` after verifying `$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt`.\\n     - Ensure `enable-debug-command` is enabled during provisioning for new nodes.\\n\\n#### B. Handling Failover Events\\n3. **Monitor cluster health:**\\n   - Use `redis-cli cluster info` to check `cluster_state:ok`.\\n   - Check logs for `cluster_redirection` errors indicating MOVED or ASK redirects.\\n4. **Automatic failover:**\\n   - Redis Cluster automatically promotes replicas to masters during node failures.\\n   - Ensure `cluster-allow-replica-migration` and related configs are set correctly.\\n5. **Manual promotion (if needed):**\\n   - If automatic failover fails, run:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n     ```\\n   - Or, in emergency, force promotion of a replica:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n     ```\\n\\n#### C. Reconfiguration & Resharding\\n6. **Check current keyslot assignments:**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n     ```\\n7. **Reshard the cluster:**\\n   - Use the [official resharding guide](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/#reshard-the-cluster).\\n   - Migrate hash slots from existing masters to new nodes:\\n     - Use `redis-cli --cluster reshard` with appropriate parameters.\\n8. **Monitor redirections and cross-slot errors:**\\n   - Use Grafana dashboards and logs to track `cluster_redirection` errors.\\n   - Minimize cross-slot commands during resharding.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Check cluster info:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli cluster info\\n  ```\\n- **Check slot assignments:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli cluster slots\\n  ```\\n- **Force replica promotion (emergency):**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n  ```\\n- **Resharding:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli --cluster reshard <host>:<port>\\n  ```\\n- **Reconfigure nodes for debug commands:**\\n  - Run `scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh` as per runbook instructions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:**\\n  - Ensure `enable-debug-command` is enabled on nodes before reconfiguration.\\n  - Backup cluster state and configuration files before major changes.\\n- **Failover Handling:**\\n  - Automatic failover is designed to promote replicas; manual intervention is only needed if automatic failover fails.\\n  - Use `CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER` cautiously; it forces promotion.\\n- **Resharding:**\\n  - Resharding is a live operation; expect some temporary errors or redirections.\\n  - Avoid cross-slot multi-key commands during resharding.\\n- **Monitoring & Logging:**\\n  - Use Grafana dashboards to monitor redirection errors and slot coverage.\\n  - Review logs for `cluster_redirection` errors to identify issues.\\n- **High Availability:**\\n  - Proper reconfiguration and failover procedures ensure minimal downtime.\\n  - Regularly test failover and resharding procedures in staging environments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nMigration procedures—cluster setup, reconfiguration, resharding, and failover handling—are interconnected processes that collectively ensure Redis remains highly available and performant. Properly executing these steps, monitoring redirection logs, and responding to failover events maintain cluster health and data integrity.                                                                                                                                                                   Migration procedures for Redis sharding, such as setting up clusters and reconfiguring nodes, are essential for distributing workload and achieving horizontal scaling, which directly impacts high availability and performance. Proper cluster setup ensures that Redis instances can failover seamlessly during failover events, with master switch logs providing critical information about role changes and failover occurrences. By combining effective sharding migration techniques with vigilant monitoring of master switch logs, infrastructure engineers can maintain Redis high availability, quickly respond to failover events, and optimize performance within complex infrastructure setups.      1.000000          0.863381                1.0        1.000000            0.349060               0.090909\n",

While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes.\\nSo, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take:\\n1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`\\n- This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel\\n2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel`\\n- Not sure why, but it’s minor\\n3.

So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status.\\nIt’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time.\\n### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)\\n[Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis)\\nsee: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md>\\n### Replication issues\\n[Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues)\\n#### Possible checks\\n[Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks)\\n#### client-output-buffer-limit\\n[Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit)\\ncheck Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf>\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n> config get client-output-buffer-limit\\n```\\n#### Checks Using Prometheus\\n[Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus)\\n##### Redis Primaries\\n[Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries)\\nList the Redis primaries using:\\n- [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1)\\n##### Redis Secondaries]  [<1-hop>\\n\\n[PatroniGCSSnapshotDelayed](/patroni/alerts/PatroniGCSSnapshotDelayed/) -

Managing nodes from 1-hop and 2-hop info involves inspecting cluster state, node roles, and slot distribution, then performing add-node and replicate commands accordingly. Proper validation and configuration ensure a healthy, scalable Redis cluster.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Instructions for Scaling and Managing Nodes\\n\\n#### 1. **Assess Current Cluster State**\\n- Run:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <any_node_address>\\n  ```\\n- Verify:\\n  - `cluster_state:ok`\\n  - `cluster_slots_ok:16384`\\n  - `cluster_known_nodes` (number of nodes)\\n  - `cluster_size` (number of masters)\\n\\n*Note:* Use `CLUSTER INFO` for a quick overview.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 2. **Identify Existing Nodes and Slots**\\n- To get detailed node info:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster nodes <any_node_address>\\n  ```\\n- Check each node’s role (master/slave), assigned slots, and health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 3. **Add New Nodes (Scaling Up)**\\n- **Add a new node to the cluster:**\\n  - SSH into the existing master node or run from a management host.\\n  - Run:\\n    ```bash\\n    sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\\\n    <new_node_address>:6379 \\\\n    <existing_master_node_address>:6379\\n    ```\\n- **Add additional nodes (replicas or shards):**\\n  - For each new node, repeat the above, replacing `<new_node_address>`.\\n\\n*Tip:* Perform this on at least one node from each shard to avoid single-sided view issues.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 4. **Assign Replicas to Masters**\\n- For each replica node:\\n  - Find the master node ID:\\n    ```bash\\n    master_id=$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster nodes <any_node_address> | grep <master_node_address> | awk '{ print $1 }')\\n    ```\\n  - Run:\\n    ```bash\\n    sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h <replica_node_address> \\\\n    cluster replicate $master_id\\n    ```\\n- Repeat for all replicas.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 5. **Validate the Cluster**\\n- Wait a few seconds for gossip to propagate.\\n- Run:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <any_node_address>\\n  ```\\n- Confirm:\\n  - `cluster_state:ok`\\n  - All `cluster_slots_ok:16384`\\n  - Correct number of nodes and slots assigned\\n  - No fail or pfail slots\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Managing Nodes from 1-hop and 2-hop Info\\n- **1-hop info:** Directly querying a node (`CLUSTER NODES`) gives immediate info about that node’s role, slots, and connected slaves.\\n- **2-hop info:** To see the broader topology, query multiple nodes and cross-reference their `cluster nodes` output to ensure all nodes are correctly connected and slots are balanced.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Key Commands Summary\\n- **Check cluster info:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <node_address>\\n  ```\\n- **Get cluster nodes:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster nodes <node_address>\\n  ```\\n- **Add node:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node <new_node>:6379 <existing_node>:6379\\n  ```\\n- **Replicate node:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h <node> cluster replicate <master_node_id>\\n  ```\\n- **Validate cluster:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info <node_address>\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n- Always perform scaling operations during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods.\\n- Ensure all nodes are reachable and properly configured.\\n- After adding nodes, monitor cluster health until `cluster_state:ok`.\\n- Use `CLUSTER SLOTS` or `CLUSTER SHARDS` to verify slot distribution.\\n- For large scale-up, consider online resharding to rebalance slots.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis procedure ensures a controlled, validated approach to scaling Redis clusters and managing nodes from both 1-hop and 2-hop perspectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      to scale up redis cluster and manage nodes, you need to create or recreate clusters from snapshots as described in the 1-hop context, and also perform scaling, upgrades, and maintenance activities outlined in the 2-hop context, such as geo patroni cluster management and managing redis cluster features, ensuring proper provisioning and management of redis nodes.      1.000000          0.762530                1.0        0.000000            0.430162               0.000000\n",

Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., ```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n1)  1) \"name\"\\n2) \"gstg-redis-cache\"        # cluster_id\\n3) \"ip\"\\n4) \"10.224.8.103\"            # ip address of the current master\\n5) \"port\"\\n6) \"6379\"\\n7) \"runid\"\\n8) \"06277f7abca059c268b2c5e2b2581d7d3bf330f1\"\\n9) \"flags\"\\n10) \"master\"\\n11) \"link-pending-commands\"\\n12) \"0\"\\n13) \"link-refcount\"\\n14) \"1\"\\n15) \"last-ping-sent\"\\n16) \"0\"\\n17) \"last-ok-ping-reply\"\\n18) \"440\"\\n19) \"last-ping-reply\"\\n20) \"440\"\\n21) \"down-after-milliseconds\"\\n22) \"10000\"\\n23) \"info-refresh\"\\n24) \"9021\"\\n25) \"role-reported\"\\n26) \"master\"\\n27) \"role-reported-time\"\\n28) \"956691745\"\\n29) \"config-epoch\"\\n30) \"51\"\\n31) \"num-slaves\"\\n32) \"2\"\\n33) \"num-other-sentinels\"\\n34) \"2\"\\n35) \"quorum\"\\n36) \"2\"\\n37) \"failover-timeout\"\\n38) \"60000\"\\n39) \"parallel-syncs\"\\n40) \"1\"\\n```\\n1.

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.]

[Section titled “Is redis running?”](#is-redis-running) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana) Grafana dashboards: - [redis](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-main/redis-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-cache](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sidekiq](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-tracechunks](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-tracechunks-main/redis-tracechunks-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-ratelimiting](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-ratelimiting-main/redis-ratelimiting-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sessions](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sessions-main/redis-sessions-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) For example, there is a Grafana chart showing number of slowlog events in redis-sidekiq (not linking it here because the panel ID changes when Grafana dashboards are deployed). ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos) <https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1w&g0.expr=redis_up%20%3C%201&g0.tab=0> ### directly on a redis host [Section titled “directly on a redis host”](#directly-on-a-redis-host) - is redis up? - `gitlab-ctl status` - can we dial redis? - `telnet localhost 6379` - can we talk to redis via `redis-cli`? ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info ``` ## How to get redis stats? [Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1) [see above](#grafana) ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1) Redis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` . It is scraped by Prometheus. See [the exporter documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) for more details. [Example `redis_exporter` metric](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=redis_commands_processed_total&g0.tab=1) in Thanos. ### redis-cli [Section titled “redis-cli”](#redis-cli) Run: - [INFO command](https://redis.io/commands/info) - [MEMORY\\_STATS command](https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats) NOTE: DO NOT USE [MONITOR] COMMAND! It streams back every command processed by the Redis server which can double the use of resources. It can overload a production machine making it unresponsive or causing an OOM kill. NOTE: DO NOT USE [KEYS] COMMAND! It will overload a production machine. ## What is causing Redis to slowdown? [Section titled “What is causing Redis to slowdown?”](#what-is-causing-redis-to-slowdown) The application relies on Redis throughput to be very high, latency spikes can be detrimental to the operation of the entire application. ### Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana”](#prometheusthanosgrafana) Explore Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana. Historical metrics might suggest a sudden change in the application behavior or traffic, for example: - operations rate, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=54> - keys rate of change, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=64> For Grafana links [see above](#grafana). ### slowlog [Section titled “slowlog”](#slowlog) The slowlog records slow Redis queries. Redis [SLOWLOG command documentation](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog). Get top 10 Redis slowlog entries: Terminal window ``` > slowlog get 10 1) 1) (integer) 5100 # A unique progressive identifier for every slow log entry. 2) (integer) 1561019091 # The unix timestamp at which the logged command was processed. 3) (integer) 21390 # The amount of time needed for its execution, in microseconds. 4) 1) \"del\" # The array composing the arguments of the command. 2) \"cache:gitlab:242234:8213877:Ci::CompareTestReportsService\" ``` To convert the timestamp, use `date -d @1561019091`. Get the command execution time threshold at which commands are logged (in microseconds): ``` > config get slowlog-log-slower-than ``` Get size of slowlog (entries are discarded like in a FIFO queue): ``` > config get slowlog-max-len ``` #### Monitoring number of slowlog entries [Section titled “Monitoring number of slowlog entries”](#monitoring-number-of-slowlog-entries) The number of entries added to the slowlog is exposed as a Prometheus metric and [there is a Grafana chart for it](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=48). #### Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog [Section titled “Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog”](#monitoring-the-rate-of-change-in-the-slowlog) A useful metric for monitoring potential slow-downs in Redis is measuring the rate of change in the `redis_slowlog_last_id`. This can be done by plotting (`changes(redis_slowlog_last_id[1h])`](../<https://prometheus.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1d&g0.expr=changes(redis_slowlog_last_id%5B1h%5D)&g0.tab=0>). ### Redis latency monitoring framework [Section titled “Redis latency monitoring framework”](#redis-latency-monitoring-framework) Redis provides a latency diagnostic tool: <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> You may need to enable it with `CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100`. From <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> : By default monitoring is disabled (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. However while the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well. #### LATENCY DOCTOR [Section titled “LATENCY DOCTOR”](#latency-doctor) Terminal window ``` > CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100 > LATENCY DOCTOR Dave, I have observed latency spikes in this Redis instance. You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave? 1. command: 5 latency spikes (average 300ms, mean deviation 120ms, period 73.40 sec). Worst all time event 500ms. I have a few advices for you: - Your current Slow Log configuration only logs events that are slower than your configured latency monitor threshold. Please use 'CONFIG, <2-hop>\\n\\npresented are an optimistic estimate, as redis will require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over. This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1> - Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example: Terminal window ``` $ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master 2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec') ``` #### Redis Sentinel [Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ### 1. Direct Answer\\nFailover and recovery procedures are essential in troubleshooting Redis slowdown causes and replication issues because they help restore service availability, isolate the problematic node, and ensure data consistency. By performing controlled failovers, you can determine if a slow or unresponsive primary is causing performance degradation or replication problems. Recovery procedures, such as re-establishing replication or promoting replicas, help identify whether issues stem from node failures, network partitions, or saturation, enabling targeted troubleshooting and minimizing downtime.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### A. Detecting and Confirming the Issue\\n1. **Monitor Redis health:** Use Sentinel or Redis CLI to check node status.\\n   ```\\n   /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <port> SENTINEL masters\\n   ```\\n2. **Identify slowdown or replication lag:** Use Redis slowlog or info commands.\\n   ```\\n   redis-cli -p <port> slowlog get 10\\n   redis-cli -p <port> info replication\\n   ```\\n\\n#### B. Initiate Failover to Test Resilience\\n3. **Perform a manual failover:** Promote a replica to primary to see if the new primary resolves the issue.\\n   ```\\n   /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n   ```\\n   - Replace `<CLUSTER_NAME>` with your cluster identifier (e.g., `gprd-redis-cache`).\\n\\n4. **Observe the new primary:** Check if the failover improves performance or resolves replication issues.\\n   ```\\n   redis-cli -p <new_primary_port> info replication\\n   ```\\n\\n#### C. Recovery Procedures\\n5. **Re-establish replication:** If a node is lagging or unresponsive, restart or resync the replica.\\n   - To resync a replica:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -p <replica_port> SLAVEOF <primary_ip> <primary_port>\\n     ```\\n   - Or, if needed, reconfigure the replica:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -p <replica_port> CONFIG REWRITE\\n     ```\\n\\n6. **Check for saturation or resource issues:** Use system tools and Redis info.\\n   ```\\n   redis-cli -p <port> info memory\\n   top / htop\\n   ```\\n\\n7. **Clear problematic data or logs if necessary:**\\n   - Delete RDB file after troubleshooting:\\n     ```\\n     rm /var/opt/gitlab/redis/dump.rdb\\n     ```\\n   - Remember to restart Redis after changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Check Sentinel status:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL masters\\n  ```\\n- **Force failover:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <sentinel_port> SENTINEL failover <CLUSTER_NAME>\\n  ```\\n- **Promote a replica manually:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <replica_port> SLAVEOF NO ONE\\n  ```\\n- **Reconfigure replica:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <replica_port> CONFIG REWRITE\\n  ```\\n- **Check replication info:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -p <port> info replication\\n  ```\\n- **Clear RDB file after troubleshooting:**\\n  ```\\n  rm /path/to/dump.rdb\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Caution with commands:** Avoid using `KEYS` or `MONITOR` commands in production as they can lock Redis or cause performance issues.\\n- **Ensure proper authentication:** Use the Redis admin password stored in secrets.\\n- **Perform failovers during maintenance windows if possible:** To prevent unintended data loss or service disruption.\\n- **Monitor Sentinel logs:** To identify causes of frequent failovers or flapping.\\n- **Resource checks:** Always verify system resources (CPU, memory, disk space) as saturation can cause slowdowns and trigger failovers.\\n- **Backup data:** Before deleting RDB files or making configuration changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:** Failover and recovery procedures help isolate whether slowdown or replication issues are due to node failures, resource saturation, or network problems. Controlled failovers test cluster resilience, while recovery steps restore replication and performance, enabling effective troubleshooting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Failover and recovery procedures are essential for addressing redis slowdown causes and replication issues by ensuring that Redis can quickly switch to a healthy master if the current one fails, and by restoring replication links. These procedures include building new Redis servers, starting replication with 'slaveof' commands, and using Sentinel to manage automatic failover. Properly executing these steps helps maintain high availability, reduces latency spikes, and resolves replication problems, thereby improving Redis performance and stability.      0.830189          0.956242                1.0        1.000000            0.879587               0.090909\n"

    "### **🎯 Why Choose 12→4**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **✅ Consistently High Answer Correctness** (+22.5% to +46.2%) - Strong technical accuracy across all runs\n",
    "2. **✅ Perfect Context Recall** (+21.4%) - Consistently retrieves most relevant documents\n",

Troubleshooting](#4-troubleshooting)\\n# Provisioning Redis Cluster\\nThis document outlines the steps for provisioning a Redis Cluster. Former attempts are documented here:\\n- [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256)\\n- [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358)\\n## Setting up instances\\n[Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances)\\nFirst, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely:\\n- `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd`\\n- `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1`\\n- `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag`\\n- `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`)\\n- `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag`\\n- `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`.\\n- `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\n- `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\nWhen configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application.\\nE.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes.\\n**Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand.\\n### 1. Generate Redis passwords\\n[Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords)\\nGenerate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using:\\n```\\nfor I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n```\\nUpdate both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master):\\n```\\n./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n```\\nUpdate the JSON payload to include the new instance details:\\n```\\n{\\n...,\\n\"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n\"redis_conf\": {\\n\"masteruser\": \"replica\",\\n\"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n\"user\": [\\n\"default off\",\\n\"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n\"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\",\\n\"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\",\\n\"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\"\\n]\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n```\\nDo the same for\\n```\\n./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n```\\nModify the existing JSON\\n```\\n{\\n\"redis_exporter\": {\\n\"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n\"env\": {\\n\"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\"\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n```, mv data.json.tmp data.json\\nvault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\nrm data.json\\nOR\\nglsh vault edit-secret chef env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets\\n#  Add the following object in .\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override :\\n#  \"<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>\": {\\n#    \"password\": <RAILS_REDACTED>\\n#  }\\n```\\nUpdate roles/-base.json with the relevant connection details. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3546).\\n### 2. Verification of config in a VM\\n[Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm)\\nCheck the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference.\\n```\\n[ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME>\\n=> \"PONG\"\\n[ gstg ] production>\\n```\\n### 3. Configure Gitlab Rails\\n[Section titled “3. Configure Gitlab Rails”](#3-configure-gitlab-rails)\\na. Update secret\\n```\\nvault kv put k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails password=<RAILS_REDACTED>\\n```\\nFor example,\\n```\\nvault kv get k8s/env/<ENV>/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\n======================== Secret Path ========================\\nk8s/data/env/gprd/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-rails\\n======= Metadata =======\\nKey                Value\\n---                -----\\ncreated_time       2023-03-18T00:33:29.790293426Z\\ncustom_metadata    <nil>\\ndeletion_time      n/a\\ndestroyed          false\\nversion            1\\n====== Data ======\\nKey         Value\\n---         -----\\npassword    <RAILS_REDACTED>\\n```\\nNote the version of the password in `vault kv get` and make sure it tallies with the external secret definition in [k8s-workload](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/master/releases/gitlab-external-secrets/values/values.yaml.gotmpl):\\n```\\ngitlab-redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails-credential-v1:\\nrefreshInterval: 0\\nsecretStoreName: gitlab-secrets\\ntarget:\\ncreationPolicy: Owner\\ndeletionPolicy: Delete\\ndata:\\n- remoteRef:\\nkey: env/{{ $env }}/ns/gitlab/redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-rails\\nproperty: password\\nversion: \"1\"\\nsecretKey: password\\n```\\nNote that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets).\\nb. Update Gitlab Rails `.Values.global.redis` accordingly.\\nEither add a new key to `.Values.global.redis.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>` or `.Values.global.redis.redisYmlOverride.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME>`. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2753).\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4.

Former attempts are documented here: - [`redis-cluster-ratelimiting`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2256) - [`redis-cluster-chat-cache`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2358) ## Setting up instances [Section titled “Setting up instances”](#setting-up-instances) First, this guide defines a few variables in `<>`, namely: - `ENV`: `pre`, `gstg`, `gprd` - `GCP_PROJECT`: `gitlab-production` or `gitlab-staging-1` - `INSTANCE_TYPE`: `feature-flag` - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME`: The name that GitLab Rails would recognise. This matches `redis.xxx.yml` or the 2nd-top-level key in `redis.yml` (top-level key being `production`) - `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS`: `RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME` but using underscore, i.e. `feature_flag` instead of `feature-flag` - `RAILS_CLASS_NAME`: The class which would connect to the new Redis Cluster. e.g. `Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag`. - `REPLICA_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `RAILS_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `EXPORTER_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) - `CONSOLE_REDACTED`: Generated in [Generate Redis passwords step](#1-generate-redis-passwords) When configuring the application, note that the name of the instance must match the object name in lowercase and kebab-case/snake-case in the application. E.g. We have `redis-cluster-chat-cache` service but in GitLab Rails, the object is `Gitlab::Redis::Chat`. Hence `chat` should be used when configuring the secret for the application in console and Kubernetes. **Note:** To avoid mistakes in manually copy-pasting the variables in `<>` above during a provisioning session, it is recommended to prepare this doc with all the variables replaced beforehand. ### 1. Generate Redis passwords [Section titled “1. Generate Redis passwords”](#1-generate-redis-passwords) Generate four passwords, `REPLICA_REDACTED`, `RAILS_REDACTED`, `EXPORTER_REDACTED`, and `CONSOLE_REDACTED` using: ``` for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done ``` Update both `redis-cluster` and `redis-exporter` gkms vault secrets using these commands in the [`chef-repo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/tree/master): ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV> ``` Update the JSON payload to include the new instance details: ``` { ..., \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"redis_conf\": { \"masteruser\": \"replica\", \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"user\": [ \"default off\", \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\", \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\", \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\", \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\" ] } } } ``` Do the same for ``` ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV> ``` Modify the existing JSON ``` { \"redis_exporter\": { \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": { \"env\": { \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\" } } } } ``` ### 2. Create Chef roles [Section titled “2. Create Chef roles”](#2-create-chef-roles) Set the new chef roles and add the new role to the list of gitlab-redis roles in -infra-prometheus-server role. An example MR can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3494). ### 3. Provision VMs [Section titled “3. Provision VMs”](#3-provision-vms) Provision the VMs via the generic-stor/google terraform module. This is done in the [config-mgmt project in the ops environment](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/). An example MR can be found [here](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5811). After the MR is merged and applied, check the VM state via: ``` gcloud compute instances list --project <GCP_PROJECT> | grep 'redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>' ``` You need to wait for the initial chef-client run to complete. One way to check is to tail the serial port output to check when the initial run is completed. An example: ``` gcloud compute --project=<GCP_PROJECT> instances tail-serial-port-output redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV> --zone us-east1-{c/b/d} ``` ### 4. Initialising the cluster [Section titled “4. Initialising the cluster”](#4-initialising-the-cluster) a. SSH into one of the instance: ``` ssh redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>-shard-01-01-db-<ENV>.c.<GCP_PROJECT>.internal ``` b. Run the following: ``` export ENV=<ENV> export PROJECT=<GCP_PROJECT> export DEPLOYMENT=redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE> ``` c. Use the following command to connect the master-nodes and initialise a working cluster. Add more shard FQDN where necessary. e.g. `$DEPLOYMENT-shard-<shard_number>-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379`. ``` sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster create \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-02-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-03-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 ``` Use the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..m}` where `n` is the number of shards and `m` is the number of instances per shard. ``` for i in {01,02,03}-{02,03}; do sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\ $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 sleep 2 done ``` Use the following command, to assign the replicas within each shard. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..n}` where necessary depending on the cluster-size. ``` for i in {01,02,03}; do for j in {02,03}; do node_id=\"$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster nodes | grep $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal | awk '{ print $1 }')\"; sudo gitlab-redis-cli -h $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-$j-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal \\ cluster replicate $node_id done done ``` ### 5. Validation [Section titled “5. Validation”](#5-validation) Wait for a few seconds as the nodes need time to gossip. Check the status via: ``` $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster info $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 redis-cluster-ratelimiting-shard-01-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal:6379 (9b0828e3...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.3:6379 (ac03fcee...) -> 0 keys | 5461 slots | 2 slaves. 10.217.21.4:6379 (f8341afd...) -> 0 keys | 5462 slots | 2 slaves. [OK] 0 keys in 3 masters. 0.00 keys per slot on average. $ sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster info | head -n7 cluster_state:ok cluster_slots_assigned:16384 cluster_slots_ok:16384 cluster_slots_pfail:0 cluster_slots_fail:0 cluster_known_nodes:9 cluster_size:3 ``` ## Configuring the applications [Section titled “Configuring the applications”](#configuring-the-applications) ### 1. Configure console instances [Section titled “1. Configure console instances”](#1-configure-console-instances) a. Proxy and authenticate to Hashicorp Vault: ``` glsh vault proxy export VAULT_PROXY_ADDR=\"socks5://localhost:18200\" glsh vault login ``` ``` vault kv get -format=json chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets | jq '.data.data' > data.json cat data.json | jq --arg PASSWORD <RAILS_REDACTED> '.\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override.<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>.password = $PASSWORD' > data.json.tmp diff -u data.json data.json.tmp mv data.json.tmp data.json vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json rm data.json OR glsh vault edit-secret chef env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets # Add the following object in .\"omnibus-gitlab\".gitlab_rb.\"gitlab-rails\".redis_yml_override : # \"<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>\": { # \"password\": <RAILS_REDACTED> # } ``` Update roles/-base.json with the relevant connection details.

Direct Answer**  \\nHashicorp Vault is used to securely store, manage, and rotate Redis cluster passwords. It acts as a centralized secrets management system, ensuring that Redis passwords are kept confidential, versioned, and easily retrievable for configuration and automation purposes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions**  \\n\\n**Step 1: Generate Redis Passwords**  \\n- Use OpenSSL to create secure, random passwords for Redis components:\\n  ```bash\\n  for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n  ```\\n- Save these passwords for updating Vault secrets.\\n\\n**Step 2: Update Vault Secrets with New Passwords**  \\n- Use `gkms-vault-edit` to update the Redis cluster secrets:\\n  ```bash\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n  ```\\n- Modify the JSON payload to include the new passwords:\\n  ```json\\n  {\\n    ...,\\n    \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n      \"redis_conf\": {\\n        \"masteruser\": \"replica\",\\n        \"masterauth\": \"<REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n        \"user\": [\\n          \"default off\",\\n          \"replica on ~* &* +@all ><REPLICA_REDACTED>\",\\n          \"console on ~* &* +@all ><CONSOLE_REDACTED>\",\\n          \"redis_exporter on +client +ping +info +config|get +cluster|info +slowlog +latency +memory +select +get +scan +xinfo +type +pfcount +strlen +llen +scard +zcard +hlen +xlen +eval allkeys ><EXPORTER_REDACTED>\",\\n          \"rails on ~* &* +@all -debug ><RAILS_REDACTED>\"\\n        ]\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n  ```\\n- Similarly, update the `redis-exporter` secrets:\\n  ```bash\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n  ```\\n  with:\\n  ```json\\n  {\\n    \"redis_exporter\": {\\n      \"redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\": {\\n        \"env\": {\\n          \"REDIS_PASSWORD\": \"<EXPORTER_REDACTED>\"\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n  ```\\n\\n**Step 3: Patch the Vault Secrets**  \\n- Save the JSON to a file, then patch the secret:\\n  ```bash\\n  vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n  ```\\n- Or use:\\n  ```bash\\n  glsh vault edit-secret chef env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets\\n  ```\\n\\n**Step 4: Update Application Configuration**  \\n- Add the password object in the `gitlab_rb` configuration:\\n  ```json\\n  \"<RAILS_INSTANCE_NAME_OMNIBUS>\": {\\n    \"password\": <RAILS_REDACTED>\\n  }\\n  ```\\n- Update roles and configuration files as per the runbook instructions.\\n\\n**Step 5: Verify Configuration in a VM**  \\n- Use `gitlab-rails console` to confirm the connection:\\n  ```bash\\n  Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with { |c| c.ping } # replace with your RAILS_CLASS_NAME\\n  ```\\n  Expect `\"PONG\"` as a response.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands**  \\n- Generate passwords:\\n  ```bash\\n  for I in REPLICA_REDACTED RAILS_REDACTED EXPORTER_REDACTED CONSOLE_REDACTED; do echo $I; openssl rand -hex 32; done\\n  ```\\n- Update Vault secrets:\\n  ```bash\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-cluster <ENV>\\n  ./bin/gkms-vault-edit redis-exporter <ENV>\\n  vault kv patch chef/env/<ENV>/shared/gitlab-omnibus-secrets @data.json\\n  ```\\n- Verify Redis connection:\\n  ```bash\\n  gitlab-rails console\\n  # then run:\\n  <RAILS_CLASS_NAME>.with { |c| c.ping }\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes**  \\n- Always generate strong, unique passwords using `openssl rand -hex 32`.\\n- Ensure Vault secrets are updated atomically to prevent configuration mismatches.\\n- Verify the configuration in a VM before deploying to production.\\n- Follow safe secret rotation procedures, especially when secrets are rotated across environments.\\n- Properly update all related configuration files and secrets management systems to reflect new passwords.\\n- Be cautious of permissions and access controls on Vault to prevent unauthorized secret access.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis structured approach ensures Redis passwords are securely managed via Hashicorp Vault, with clear procedures for updating, verifying, and deploying secrets.

It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability). It’s not a full DBMS with\\nguaranteed write semantics (and performance implications to match), but it is sufficiently persistent that there wouldn’t, [Section titled “Troubleshooting Pointers”](#troubleshooting-pointers)\\n- [A survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab](../redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres)\\n- [../redis/redis.md](../redis/redis)\\n## Summary\\n[Section titled “Summary”](#summary)\\nThe Sessions Redis instances are a distinct Redis used by Rails for web session storage/handling. Per-session storage is typically fairly small (hundreds of bytes), but there are a lot of them, they are touched a lot by active users, and some can be big either naturally or unexpectedly.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nRedis is deployed in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis.\\n## Scalability\\n[Section titled “Scalability”](#scalability)\\nSingle threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis, but at initial move we are anticipating something in the order of 20% absolute CPU usage. Data storage for sessions is in the order of 10GB (at end of 2021).\\n## Availability\\n[Section titled “Availability”](#availability)\\nThe usual redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\n## Durability\\n[Section titled “Durability”](#durability)\\nSession data is an interesting hybrid; we do *generally* want durability/persistence, but can tolerate some loss of data (generally a log-out for affected users). As such while we persist to disk with RDB, we also have maxmemory and an eviction policy (volatile-ttl) that will, if necessary, evict data with the shortest TTL remaining (sessions that were close to expiry anyway). Alerting is set to tell us if we are approaching that state of affairs, but that policy gives us space to mitigate/manage the situation without disaster.\\n## Monitoring/Alerting\\n[Section titled “Monitoring/Alerting”](#monitoringalerting)\\nGenerally the same as other Redis clusters, but with special handling for monitoring maximum memory (as a proportion of the configured limit, not the system limit), and alerting if redis\\_evicted\\_keys\\_total raises above zero (meaning we missed memory saturation)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis-sessions/README.md)\\n[Previous\\nRedis Registry Cache Service](/redis-registry-cache/)   [Next\\nRedis Sidekiq Service](/redis-sidekiq/), Note that when rotating secrets (eg having v1 in `gstg` and v2 in `gprd`), follow a safe and controlled rollout as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-kubernetes-secrets).\\nb.

It will overload a production machine.\\n## What is causing Redis to slowdown?\\n[Section titled “What is causing Redis to slowdown?”](#what-is-causing-redis-to-slowdown)\\nThe application relies on Redis throughput to be very high, latency spikes can be detrimental to the operation of the entire application., Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf)\\ninteractive:\\n```\\nREDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli\\n```\\nor oneliners:\\n```\\nREDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10\\n```\\n### Building a new Redis server and starting replication\\n[Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication)\\nNOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial>\\nFrom time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes.\\nSo, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take:\\n1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`\\n- This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel\\n2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel`\\n- Not sure why, but it’s minor\\n3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master:\\n1.

So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status.\\nIt’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time.\\n### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)\\n[Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses

Verification of config in a VM [Section titled “2. Verification of config in a VM”](#2-verification-of-config-in-a-vm) Check the confirmation detail by using `gitlab-rails console` inside a console instance. You may need to run `chef-client` to update the node and render the updated configuration files. This is important as the pipeline does not check the correctness of the config files. This may impact the deploy-node as GitLab Rails connects to Redis instances on start-up. There was a past incident of such an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16322) for reference. ``` [ gstg ] production> Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag.with{|c| c.ping} # replace Gitlab::Redis::FeatureFlag with <RAILS_CLASS_NAME> => \"PONG\" [ gstg ] production> ``` ### 3.

Direct Answer:**  \\nNo, GitLab is not used for managing Redis configurations directly in the infrastructure setup. Redis configurations are managed through Chef cookbooks (`gitlab-redis`, `gitlab-redis-cluster`, `omnibus-gitlab`) and the configuration files (like `redis.conf`) are generated and applied via these tools. The runbook documentation indicates that Redis is managed as part of GitLab's infrastructure automation but does not specify GitLab itself as a configuration management tool for Redis; instead, it uses Chef and Omnibus configurations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions Based on Runbook Documentation:**\\n\\n**A. Managing Redis Configurations**  \\n- Redis configurations are stored in `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf`.  \\n- Configuration changes (e.g., buffer limits) are applied by editing this file or via Chef recipes.  \\n- To apply configuration changes, typically run:  \\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure\\n  ```  \\n  This regenerates the configs and restarts Redis with the new settings.\\n\\n**B. Updating Specific Redis Settings (e.g., buffer limits)**  \\n- Convert human-readable sizes to bytes (e.g., 4GB = 4294967296).  \\n- Use the `redis-cli` to set parameters dynamically:  \\n  ```\\n  REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2)\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli config set client-output-buffer-limit \"slave 4294967296 4294967296 0\"\\n  ```  \\n- Note: For persistent changes, update `redis.conf` and run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.\\n\\n**C. Restarting Redis**  \\n- If Redis is down, start it with:  \\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl start redis\\n  ```  \\n- To restart Redis after configuration changes:  \\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n  ```\\n\\n**D. Handling Redis Failures or Resyncs**  \\n- Check logs at `/var/log/gitlab/redis/current`.  \\n- Restart Redis if services are down:  \\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis\\n  ```  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands and Configuration Procedures:**\\n\\n| Purpose | Command / Procedure | Notes |\\n|---------|-----------------------|--------|\\n| Check Redis status | `gitlab-ctl status` | Verify if Redis is running |\\n| Start Redis | `gitlab-ctl start redis` | When Redis is down |\\n| Restart Redis | `gitlab-ctl restart redis` | After config changes or failures |\\n| Set config dynamically | | See above for `redis-cli config set` commands |\\n| Edit configuration file | `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf` | For persistent changes, then reconfigure |\\n| Reconfigure Redis | `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` | Applies config file changes |\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n\\n- Redis configurations are managed via Chef and Omnibus; direct manual edits should be followed by a reconfigure to ensure consistency.\\n- For dynamic adjustments (like buffer limits), use `redis-cli config set` commands.\\n- Always check logs and service status after making changes.\\n- Do not manually edit `redis.conf` on running systems without reconfiguring, as changes may be overwritten.\\n- The runbook emphasizes using `gitlab-ctl` commands for lifecycle management, not GitLab itself for configuration management.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nWhile GitLab manages Redis as part of its infrastructure, it does not use GitLab itself as a configuration management tool for Redis. Instead, it relies on Chef and Omnibus to handle Redis configurations, with commands and procedures documented in the runbook for safe management and troubleshooting.

Per-session storage is typically fairly small (hundreds of bytes), but there are a lot of them, they are touched a lot by active users, and some can be big either naturally or unexpectedly.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nRedis is deployed in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis.\\n## Scalability\\n[Section titled “Scalability”](#scalability)\\nSingle threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis, but at initial move we are anticipating something in the order of 20% absolute CPU usage. Data storage for sessions is in the order of 10GB (at end of 2021).\\n## Availability\\n[Section titled “Availability”](#availability)\\nThe usual redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\n## Durability\\n[Section titled “Durability”](#durability)\\nSession data is an interesting hybrid; we do *generally* want durability/persistence, but can tolerate some loss of data (generally a log-out for affected users). As such while we persist to disk with RDB, we also have maxmemory and an eviction policy (volatile-ttl) that will, if necessary, evict data with the shortest TTL remaining (sessions that were close to expiry anyway). Alerting is set to tell us if we are approaching that state of affairs, but that policy gives us space to mitigate/manage the situation without disaster.\\n## Monitoring/Alerting\\n[Section titled “Monitoring/Alerting”](#monitoringalerting)\\nGenerally the same as other Redis clusters, but with special handling for monitoring maximum memory (as a proportion of the configured limit, not the system limit), and alerting if redis\\_evicted\\_keys\\_total raises above zero (meaning we missed memory saturation)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis-sessions/README.md)\\n[Previous\\nRedis Registry Cache Service](/redis-registry-cache/)   [Next\\nRedis Sidekiq Service](/redis-sidekiq/), - [Network partition](#network-partition)\\n- [Persistence Guarantees](#persistence-guarantees)\\n- [What do we store?](#what-do-we-store)\\n- [Clients](#clients)\\n- [What about redis cluster?](#what-about-redis-cluster)\\n- [Maintanence](#maintanence)\\n- [Reconfigure](#reconfigure)\\n- [Debugging and Diagnosis](#debugging-and-diagnosis)\\n- [Identifying the primary](#identifying-the-primary)\\n- [Basic stats](#basic-stats)\\n- [Slowlogs](#slowlogs)\\n- [ElasticSearch analysis](#elasticsearch-analysis)\\n- [Monitor commands](#monitor-commands)\\n- [Flamegraphs](#flamegraphs)\\n- [Bigkeys](#bigkeys)\\n# A survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab\\nSee also <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/redis.html> which covers some of the same\\nground, but with a developer orientation and the SRE-oriented [runbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md)\\n## What is Redis\\n[Section titled “What is Redis”](#what-is-redis)\\nRedis is a fast in-memory key-value store. It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks. We have had\\nscaling problems in the past on GitLab.com where the single CPU became the bottleneck, and our architectural design\\nhas evolved to take that into account.\\n## Why do we use it?\\n[Section titled “Why do we use it?”](#why-do-we-use-it)\\nWe use it both as a cache (for performance savings) and to store various types of persistent data, either directly and\\nexplicitly (typically from Rails), or implicitly by using Sidekiq or `Rails.cache`\\nCaching for performance is primarily to reduce the load on other systems, particularly Postgres and Gitaly which are often\\nbottlenecks (or single points of failure) This can also save time in the web tier (e.g. rendering Markdown), but more\\nas a side-effect than the direct reason.\\n## Architecture\\n[Section titled “Architecture”](#architecture)\\nFor gitlab.com, as at September 2023, we have 11 sets of Redis instances, each handling a distinct use case:\\nRoleNodesClientsSentinel?Persistence?Cache for `Rails.cache`redis-cluster-cache-XX-YYPuma workers, Sidekiq workersNoNoneCache for Chat ([To be decommissioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/19221))redis-cluster-chat-cache-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Feature flagredis-cluster-feature-flag-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneCache for Repository dataredis-repository-cache-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)NoneSidekiq job queuesredis-sidekiq-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsPersistent shared stateredis-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsCI build trace chunksredis-tracechunks-XXPuma workers (API), Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 secondsRatelimiting (RackAttack/App)redis-cluster-ratelimiting-XX-YYPuma workersNoNoneSessionsredis-sessions-XXPuma workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyLatest WAL pointerredis-db-load-balancing-XXPuma workers, Sidekiq workersYes (localhost)RDB dump every 900 seconds, but also an eviction policyPub/Subredis-pubsub-XXPuma workers, WorkhorseYes (localhost)No\\nThe split is *largely* a form of functional partitioning for scalability (see single threaded comments above), but also\\nbecause the application expects the non-cache instances to persist data across failures or restarts so those instances\\nmust write data to disk periodically (in addition to replication/failover capability).

Sometimes we have incidents like\\n[#5478](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/5478) where we end up with invalid data in the cache, and no convenient way to\\nclear it. This document describes an approach for deleting a specified set of\\ncache keys on GitLab.com without consuming excessive Redis resources.\\nThis approach is split into two phases:\\n1. Obtain the keys to be deleted (against a secondary)\\n2. Delete the specified keys (against the primary)\\nBy doing this, we gain a few benefits:\\n1. We perform as few operations on the primary as necessary. Secondaries do not\\nreceive application traffic, and so have more headroom and can tolerate being\\nblocked briefly.\\n2. We can retain a list of deleted keys for later inspection - for instance, if\\na user reports an issue, we can check if their cache key was in the list.\\n3. Obtaining the keys to be deleted may be an iterative, exploratory process. We\\ndo not want to conflate this with data deletion, which should ideally be as\\nsimple as possible.\\n(In the future we may move to having [version-based cache invalidation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9815), where\\nthis will be simpler. One example is the way it’s possible to [invalidate the\\nMarkdown cache](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/invalidate_markdown_cache.html) - which is in Postgres, not Redis - via the API.)\\n## Step 1: obtain the keys to be deleted\\n[Section titled “Step 1: obtain the keys to be deleted”](#step-1-obtain-the-keys-to-be-deleted)\\n**On a secondary**, we can run a Ruby script like the below. `REDIS_PASSWORD` is\\nprovided as an environment variable.

                                            **1. Direct Answer:**\\nAn SSL Certificate is a digital credential used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between a client (like a web browser) and a server (such as a website). It verifies the server’s identity and enables data to be transmitted securely over the internet using protocols like HTTPS.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook Documentation and general knowledge):**\\n\\n**Step 1: Understand what an SSL Certificate is**\\n- It is a cryptographic certificate issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that contains the server’s public key, identity details, and the CA’s digital signature.\\n- It ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for web communications.\\n\\n**Step 2: Recognize its purpose**\\n- Used to enable HTTPS, providing encrypted communication.\\n- Validates the server’s identity to prevent impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks.\\n\\n**Step 3: Obtain an SSL Certificate**\\n- Generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) on your server.\\n- Submit the CSR to a trusted CA (e.g., Let's Encrypt, DigiCert).\\n- Receive the issued SSL certificate files.\\n\\n**Step 4: Install the SSL Certificate**\\n- Place the certificate files on your server.\\n- Configure your web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) to use the certificate and private key.\\n- Restart the web server to apply changes.\\n\\n**Step 5: Verify the SSL Certificate**\\n- Use tools like SSL Labs’ SSL Server Test or browser inspection to confirm proper installation and validity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands and Configurations:**\\n\\n- **Generating CSR and Private Key:**\\n```bash\\nopenssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout yourdomain.key -out yourdomain.csr\\n```\\n\\n- **Installing Certificate Files:**\\n  - Place the certificate (`yourdomain.crt`) and private key (`yourdomain.key`) on the server.\\n  - For Nginx, update your server block:\\n```nginx\\nserver {\\n    listen 443 ssl;\\n    server_name yourdomain.com;\\n\\n    ssl_certificate /path/to/yourdomain.crt;\\n    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/yourdomain.key;\\n\\n    # other configurations\\n}\\n```\\n- **Restart Web Server:**\\n```bash\\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\\n# or\\nsudo systemctl restart apache2\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n- Always keep your private key secure; never share it.\\n- Use a trusted CA to avoid browser security warnings.\\n- Regularly renew your SSL certificates before expiration.\\n- Ensure your server’s SSL configuration follows best practices for security (e.g., disabling outdated protocols).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\nAn SSL Certificate is essential for securing web traffic. The process involves generating a CSR, obtaining a certificate from a CA, installing it on your server, and verifying its proper operation. Proper management of SSL certificates enhances security and trustworthiness of your web services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           SSL Certificate Expiring or Expired is mentioned in the context, indicating it is a certificate that may be nearing or past its expiration date, which is relevant for maintaining secure connections.      0.000000          0.797678           0.000000        1.000000            0.115020               0.000000\n",

The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Why partition?](#why-partition)\\n- [Timing](#timing)\\n- [Determining what to split off](#determining-what-to-split-off)\\n- [Implementation](#implementation)\\n- [Application changes](#application-changes)\\n- [Infrastructure changes](#infrastructure-changes)\\n- [VMs](#vms)\\n- [K8s](#k8s)\\n- [Redis-cluster](#redis-cluster)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Migration process](#migration-process)\\n- [Verification](#verification)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Why partition?](#why-partition)\\n- [Timing](#timing)\\n- [Determining what to split off](#determining-what-to-split-off)\\n- [Implementation](#implementation)\\n- [Application changes](#application-changes)\\n- [Infrastructure changes](#infrastructure-changes)\\n- [VMs](#vms)\\n- [K8s](#k8s)\\n- [Redis-cluster](#redis-cluster)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Migration process](#migration-process)\\n- [Verification](#verification)\\n# Functional Partitioning\\n## Why partition?\\n[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition)\\nRedis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done.\\nIn the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well.\\nThe other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system.\\n## Timing\\n[Section titled “Timing”](#timing), replication resynchronization). If all 3 nodes fail at once, the entire cache will be wiped; this is not ideal but\\nacceptable as it will be refilled on demand. For ratelimiting, the data has only short term usefulness anyway (generally\\n1 minute, with some up to 3 minutes) so complete loss is not significant.\\n## What do we store?\\n[Section titled “What do we store?”](#what-do-we-store)\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/419> contains some summary analysis of the keyspace across\\nthe persistent and cache instances, as at July 2020. This will change over time as the code base evolves, but the link\\nprovides some indication what we’re storing (it’s not as wide a range of things as you might expect in the\\npersistent instance).\\nThe data stored in the sidekiq instances is not really under our control (it’s whatever sidekiq needs to do its job).\\nSome details on that are available in [Sidekiq Survival Guide for SREs](../../sidekiq/sidekiq-survival-guide-for-sres).\\nThe data in the tracechunks instance is exclusively the output of CI jobs on its way into Object Storage (received by\\nand API request, written into Redis, and a Sidekiq job immediately scheduled to asynchronously write it to Object Storage);\\nwhile important, it is also extremely transient, and under normal circumstances there should be no significant build up\\nof data in this instance. Any such build up implies a problem (Sidekiq not processing, perhaps?) and so we have\\nparticularly low alert thresholds for memory saturation on this instance. At the time we chose to split this instance\\nfrom the primary persistent (shared state) instance (mid 2021), CI trace chunks were responsible for roughly 60% of the\\ndata throughput into/out of the shared state redis, and 16% of Redis calls.\\nThe data in the ratelimiting instance is a set of keys identifying actors (typically users, IP addresses, or in some\\ncases projects) and activities, with the value being the count of usage in the current period (the period is also encoded\\ninto the key name). TTLs are used to expire these automatically so there’s no manual cleanup by clients, it is automatic\\nand internal to Redis.\\nThe data in the sessions instance is exclusively that related to web sessions.\\n## Clients\\n[Section titled “Clients”](#clients)\\nMost of the clients are Ruby, specifically Rails code on the web, api, git, and sidekiq nodes. Workhorse (in Go) also\\n[uses](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/blob/master/README.md#redis) Redis to do long polling for CI build requests.\\nRails uses the generic [connection\\_pool](https://github.com/mperham/connection_pool) to maintain long running connections\\nwhich are used by threads/workers as necessary, which is particularly important as redis is typically expected to be\\nvery fast and low latency.\\nSee [High Availability](#high-availability) for some comments regarding connections via sentinels.\\n## What about redis cluster?\\n[Section titled “What about redis cluster?”](#what-about-redis-cluster)\\n[Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec) is a Redis feature that lets you horizontally shard data across\\nmultiple machines. If any one of our Redis clusters grows too large to fit in memory on a single machine or such that\\nthe single-threaded CPU becomes a hard limit, then Redis Cluster is a possible mitigation. Manually sharding the data\\nis an alternative approach, e.g. having more than one cache cluster and dividing the types of keys up in some way using\\napplication controlled logic, or splitting the sidekiq processing onto multiple clusters. Neither option is low effort.\\nSee the [Redis Cluster documentation for more details](../../redis/redis-cluster).\\nSee:\\n1. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9788>\\n2. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/305>\\n## Maintanence\\n[Section titled “Maintanence”](#maintanence)\\n### Reconfigure\\n[Section titled “Reconfigure”](#reconfigure)\\nIn order to apply config changes, we need to run a `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.

This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up.\\nReplication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream.\\n<https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1>\\n##### Redis Replication Events\\n[Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events)\\n- Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over.

“Logging”](#logging) - [system](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/a10c2cd2b710f9eb65b13b9a2a328d51) The TraceChunks redis instances is a distinct redis cluster for storing CI build trace chunks immediately when received by the API from runners, before they are asynchronously (Ci::BuildTraceChunkFlushWorker) moved from there to ObjectStorage (as configured in .com; the database is another target option, but we don’t do that anymore). The data is important and persistent but transient (seconds to 10s of seconds normally, probably not minutes, definitely not hours, unless something has gone horribly wrong). This was split because as found in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327469#note_556531587> these trace chunks were (at the time) responsible for about 60% of the network throughput by bytes on the persistent redis, and 16% of the Redis calls, and it is a distinctive enough workload/usage pattern that splitting it out was deemed a good thing. Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters) Single threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then) The usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> ) Data is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable. Uses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover from. -]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ### 1. Direct Answer\\n**gitlab.com** is the main hosted platform for GitLab, a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides source code management, CI/CD, and other collaboration features. It is operated by GitLab Inc. and hosted on GitLab's infrastructure, which includes various services like Gitaly, Redis, and others to support its operations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Based on Runbook and Context)\\nWhile the runbook documentation primarily covers Redis and Gitaly procedures, understanding what gitlab.com is can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n**a. Understand the Platform Components:**\\n- GitLab.com is a large-scale deployment of GitLab, utilizing multiple services including:\\n  - **Gitaly** for Git repository storage and access.\\n  - **Redis** for caching, rate limiting, sessions, and other ephemeral data.\\n  - **Workhorse** for handling web requests.\\n  - **Other microservices** for artifact registry, CI, and more.\\n\\n**b. Recognize the Infrastructure:**\\n- The platform relies on high-availability setups with Redis Sentinel for Redis failover.\\n- Gitaly handles repository data, with procedures for upgrades, profiling, and data integrity.\\n- The system is designed for resilience, with automatic failover, replication, and monitoring.\\n\\n**c. Use the Runbook for Maintenance and Troubleshooting:**\\n- For Redis-related issues, follow the runbook sections on failover, replication, and configuration.\\n- For Gitaly issues, refer to the relevant sections on latency, profiling, and data corruption.\\n- For platform-wide understanding, consult the overview and architecture documentation linked in the runbook.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands and Configuration\\n- To check Redis Sentinel configuration:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo grep redis_sentinels /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb\\n  ```\\n- To get Redis master via Sentinel:\\n  ```bash\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -h <sentinel-host> -p 26379 sentinel masters\\n  ```\\n- To reconfigure GitLab (e.g., after changes):\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure\\n  ```\\n- For Redis health checks:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli ping\\n  redis-cli info replication\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **No direct user interaction with \"gitlab.com\" as a service;** it is the hosted platform.\\n- The platform relies heavily on **high availability** mechanisms like Sentinel for Redis.\\n- **Maintenance and troubleshooting** should follow the runbook procedures, especially for Redis failover, replication, and configuration.\\n- **Ensure proper access** to the infrastructure components (e.g., Sentinel hosts, Redis nodes) before performing operations.\\n- Be aware that **failures or slowness** in Redis or Gitaly can impact gitlab.com availability, so monitor using Prometheus dashboards and logs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\ngitlab.com is the hosted GitLab platform, supported by a complex infrastructure including Redis, Gitaly, and other microservices. Proper understanding and maintenance of these components are essential for ensuring platform stability.

It offers a number of data types, from simple strings to sets, hashes,\\nor complex data types like HyperLogLog. It is fundamentally single-threaded in its core loop, which keeps the\\nimplementation simple and robust (e.g. tasks execute serially with no lock contention). However, that means it is\\nconstrained to the performance of a single CPU, and any slow task delays the start of other queued tasks.

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., - workhorse\\n- [Workhorse Service](/workhorse/)\\n- [Workhorse Apdex Degradation](/workhorse/workhorse-apdex-degradation/)\\n- workspaces\\n- [Remote Development Workspaces Service](/workspaces/)\\n- zoekt\\n- [Exact code search Service](/zoekt/)\\n(() => {\\nconst scroller = document.getElementById('starlight\\_\\_sidebar');\\nif (!window.\\_starlightScrollRestore || !scroller) return;\\nscroller.scrollTop = window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\ndelete window.\\_starlightScrollRestore;\\n})();\\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)[Code Context](https://code-context.runway.gitlab.net/runbooks-docs)\\nSelect theme   DarkLightAuto\\nStarlightThemeProvider.updatePickers();\\nconst a=document.getElementById(\"starlight\\_\\_sidebar\"),n=a?.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-state-persist\"),o=\"sl-sidebar-state\",i=()=>{let t=[];const e=n?.dataset.hash||\"\";try{const s=sessionStorage.getItem(o),r=JSON.parse(s||\"{}\");Array.isArray(r.open)&&r.hash===e&&(t=r.open)}catch{}return{hash:e,open:t,scroll:a?.scrollTop||0}},c=t=>{try{sessionStorage.setItem(o,JSON.stringify(t))}catch{}},d=()=>c(i()),l=(t,e)=>{const s=i();s.open[e]=t,c(s)};n?.addEventListener(\"click\",t=>{if(!(t.target instanceof Element))return;const e=t.target.closest(\"summary\")?.closest(\"details\");if(!e)return;const s=e.querySelector(\"sl-sidebar-restore\"),r=parseInt(s?.dataset.index||\"\");isNaN(r)||l(!e.open,r)});addEventListener(\"visibilitychange\",()=>{document.visibilityState===\"hidden\"&&d()});addEventListener(\"pageHide\",d);\\nOn this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n## On this page\\n- [Overview](#_top)\\n- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)\\n- [Glossary](#glossary)\\n- [Observability](#observability)\\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\\n- [What is the state of the cluster?](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\n- [How to initialize a new cluster](#how-to-initialize-a-new-cluster)\\n- [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n# Redis Cluster\\n## Core concepts\\n[Section titled “Core concepts”](#core-concepts)\\nRedis Cluster is a mode of Redis to enable horizontal scaling. The dataset is divided among multiple nodes, allowing the computational load to be distributed.\\nHow does Redis Cluster differ from non-clustered Sentinel-based Redis instances?, Redis is in the usual 3-node single-primary/two-replica VM configuration, with sentinels on the same VMs as Redis (as for persistent and sidekiq clusters)\\nSingle threaded CPU is the normal constraint for Redis but due to the large data transfers networking *may* become a constraint before CPU does on this cluster, although there is a *lot* of headroom (2 orders of magnitude) at this writing (2021) and scaling up the instances is possible to obtain more (or maybe the limits will be higher by then)\\nThe usual persistent redis availability expectations for our 3-node clusters apply (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres.md#high-availability> )\\nData is expected to be largely persistent; some data loss may occur during an unplanned failover event, but in all normal operations all data in this instance is expected to be fully durable.\\nUses mostly the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters, except for memory saturation which is deliberately set very low; the transient nature of the data here means any build up is abnormal and should be investigated early while it is easier to recover

[Section titled “Logging”](#logging) - system The Chat Cache Redis Cluster instances is a distinct Redis Cluster used by the GitLab Rails [chat features](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410521). Redis is in a 3-node-per-shard (single-primary/two-replica per shard) VM configuration, in cluster mode. The node count will start off at 3 but will increase as we scale horizontally. Uses the same metrics-catalog definitions as for the other Redis clusters.

Direct Answer:**\\n\\nConnecting to various services via Teleport provides secure, unified, and controlled access to multiple infrastructure components—including PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters—by establishing SSH tunnels or proxy connections. This setup simplifies management, enhances security, and enables SREs to perform administrative tasks (like failover, configuration, or troubleshooting) on PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters without exposing direct network access or managing multiple access points. In the context of Redis infrastructure, this multi-service access via Teleport ensures consistent, secure, and auditable management across different data stores and services.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n\\n**A. Accessing PostgreSQL and Patroni Clusters via Teleport**\\n\\n1. **Authenticate with Teleport:**\\n   - Use your Teleport CLI or Web UI to authenticate:\\n     ```\\n     tctl login <cluster-name>\\n     ```\\n   - Ensure your user has the necessary roles and permissions to access PostgreSQL and Patroni services.\\n\\n2. **Establish a Secure Proxy Connection:**\\n   - For command-line access, create a local port forwarding or use Teleport's `proxy` command:\\n     ```\\n     tsh proxy ssh <service-hostname> --target=<target-service>\\n     ```\\n   - Alternatively, use `tsh` to connect directly to the service:\\n     ```\\n     tsh ssh <service-hostname>\\n     ```\\n   - This creates an SSH tunnel or proxy, routing your local port to the remote service securely.\\n\\n3. **Connect to PostgreSQL:**\\n   - Use a PostgreSQL client pointing to the local forwarded port:\\n     ```\\n     psql -h localhost -p <local-port> -U <user> -d <database>\\n     ```\\n   - The `<local-port>` is the port forwarded via Teleport.\\n\\n4. **Connect to Patroni-managed PostgreSQL:**\\n   - Once connected via Teleport, you can run Patroni commands or connect directly to the PostgreSQL instances managed by Patroni, using the forwarded connection.\\n\\n5. **Managing Redis Infrastructure:**\\n   - Similarly, access Redis services through Teleport tunnels if Redis is configured to accept such connections, or via dedicated proxies.\\n   - For Redis clusters, connect to the proxy or node endpoints via Teleport to perform management or troubleshooting.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Key Commands:**\\n\\n- **Login to Teleport:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh login <cluster-name>\\n  ```\\n- **Create SSH Proxy to a Service:**\\n  ```\\n  tsh proxy ssh <service-hostname> --target=<service-port>\\n  ```\\n- **Connect to PostgreSQL via psql:**\\n  ```\\n  psql -h localhost -p <local-port> -U <user> -d <database>\\n  ```\\n- **Connect to Redis (if applicable):**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -h localhost -p <redis-port>\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Important Notes:**\\n\\n- **Prerequisites:**\\n  - Ensure your user has the correct Teleport roles and permissions to access the specific services.\\n  - Teleport must be configured with access to the PostgreSQL, Patroni, and Redis nodes.\\n  - Proper SSH keys or certificates should be in place for authentication.\\n\\n- **Security & Auditing:**\\n  - Teleport provides audit logs of all access, ensuring compliance and traceability.\\n  - Do not expose Redis or PostgreSQL directly to the internet; always use Teleport proxies.\\n\\n- **Operational Considerations:**\\n  - Use Teleport's `tsh` commands for consistent, secure access.\\n  - For high-availability management (e.g., failover), connect via Teleport to run Patroni commands or Redis cluster management commands securely.\\n\\n- **Additional Context:**\\n  - This approach centralizes multi-service access, reduces network complexity, and improves security posture.\\n  - It aligns with best practices for managing multi-service infrastructure in a secure, auditable manner.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nConnecting via Teleport streamlines multi-service management by providing secure, auditable tunnels to PostgreSQL, Patroni, and Redis clusters. This setup enables SREs to perform administrative and troubleshooting tasks efficiently without exposing direct network access, ensuring consistent management across the infrastructure.  Connecting to various services via Teleport enables secure and streamlined access to multiple infrastructure components, including PostgreSQL and Patroni clusters, by providing centralized authentication and access management. This facilitates troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintenance of these clusters within complex setups. In the context of Redis infrastructure, Teleport's ability to connect to diverse services ensures that engineers can efficiently manage Redis databases alongside PostgreSQL and Patroni, supporting high availability and performance. By enabling multi-service access through a unified platform, Teleport simplifies multi-hop workflows, allowing engineers to perform multi-layered operations—such as connecting to Redis clusters, then accessing PostgreSQL or Patroni clusters—without compromising security or efficiency.      1.000000          0.877649           1.000000        1.000000            0.644860               0.000000\n",

[```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.\\n**resharding**: Migrating ownership of some hash slots from one shard to another. This is a dynamic online operation, where Redis keys are migrated between nodes. During a resharding operation, reads and writes to the keys being migrated are semantically safe but incur some extra overhead. Also, multi-key requests may temporarily fail during the transitional state. There are some documented corner cases where a failed resharding attempt must be manually completed. In our environments, because we do not intend to dynamically add/remove nodes, resharding will be a rare and planned event (e.g. when adding new nodes to the cluster for additional capacity), not a frequent automated background activity.\\nreplica migration - an optional feature that allows the cluster to dynamically reassign a replica from one master to another, to ensure all masters have at least N replicas. This feature aims to improve availability. However, it can counter-intuitively harm availability in either of 2 ways: it can lead to a master and its replicas being in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140700451)), or it can lead to accumulating a majority of masters in the same availability zone ([details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1962#note_1140436657)). This feature can be disabled ([cluster-allow-replica-migration](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1662-L1668)) or tuned ([cluster-migration-barrier](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/redis.conf#L1642-L1660)). This is one of the topics to be addressed by scalability#2071.\\n## Observability\\n[Section titled “Observability”](#observability)\\nFor most parts, the Grafana dashboard is the same as a Sentinel-based Redis dashboard. The difference lies in:\\n1. Cluster-specific panel: This panel tracks the slot coverage and state of nodes in the cluster. The components are defined in [`libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/ff4ff9dd29ee417a4a7d1940178c3085cc25730f/libsonnet/gitlab-dashboards/redis_common_graphs.libsonnet#L449).\\n2. `cluster_redirection` error SLI - tracks the rate of MOVED and ASK redirections. Redirections should only happen on (1) failover (requests are redirected to the new master), (2) resharding (requests are redirected to the new slot owner).\\nCross-slot errors are prevented on the application side and should not reach the servers except for pipelined operations during resharding. The volume can be tracked on logs under 2 groups of fields:\\n1. `json.redis_<functional shard>_allowed_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of [allowed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/92312944bb8a827b5d00509a5d07d0fe8ee4955d/lib/gitlab/instrumentation/redis_cluster_validator.rb#L205) cross-slot calls (i.e. commands are accounted for and are running on non-cluster-based Redis)\\n2. `json.redis_<functional_shard>_cross_slot_calls` shows the volume of cross-slot commands (not accounted for or running on Redis Cluster)\\n## Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “Troubleshooting”](#troubleshooting)\\n### What is the state of the cluster?\\n[Section titled “What is the state of the cluster?”](#what-is-the-state-of-the-cluster)\\nSome commands to understand the overall state:, ```\\nKeep a check on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n```\\n- During and after migration, Redis clients will receive `redirections` to contact the new owner of keyslots. These are not errors themselves as Redis clients would update their internal mapping of `keyslot -> master` upon receiving redirection from server. The redirections will take time to taper off and will definitely be gone after a new deployment in the environment, as all pods will be rotated in that scenario and will start off with up-to-date keyslot mapping.\\n## Key metrics to observe\\n[Section titled “Key metrics to observe”](#key-metrics-to-observe)\\nBelow is a list of some of the key metrics to check for:\\n- Redis service error ratio e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?from=now-6h&orgId=1&to=now&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=3422679610)\\n- Redis Cluster Slots Failed e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?orgId=1&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=115&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n- Redirections for the clients e.g. [Dashboard link](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cluster-ratelimiting-main/redis-cluster-ratelimiting3a-overview?orgId=1&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=PA258B30F88C30650&var-environment=gprd&var-shard=All&viewPanel=117&from=now-6h&to=now)\\n[Edit page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/edit/master/docs/redis/scaling-redis-cluster.md)\\n[Previous\\nA survival guide for SREs to working with Redis at GitLab](/redis/redis-survival-guide-for-sres/)   [Next\\nRedis Cluster Cache Service](/redis-cluster-cache/), - [How to recover from all nodes going down](#how-to-recover-from-all-nodes-going-down)\\n- [How to force promotion of a replica in an emergency where Redis cannot heal itself](#how-to-force-promotion-of-a-replica-in-an-emergency-where-redis-cannot-heal-itself)\\n- [How to do online resharding (with warnings)?](#how-to-do-online-resharding-with-warnings)\\n- [How do we rotate passwords in the ACL list?](#how-do-we-rotate-passwords-in-the-acl-list)\\n# Redis Cluster\\n## Core concepts\\n[Section titled “Core concepts”](#core-concepts)\\nRedis Cluster is a mode of Redis to enable horizontal scaling.

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., - (1) is FQDN of the Redis server\\n- (2) is the port number of Redis server\\n- **(3) is the node ID of the Redis instance** and required in resharding commands\\n- (4) is IP address of Redis instance\\n### 2. Calibrate the batch size for migration\\n[Section titled “2. Calibrate the batch size for migration”](#2-calibrate-the-batch-size-for-migration)\\nAt first, make a few migrations with incrementally increasing `BATCH_SIZE`, to determine a suitable size which does not cause large CPU/memory saturation spikes on the existing Redis instances and also is fast enough to complete migration within a few hours. Larger `BATCH_SIZE` will finish faster but will consume more CPU/memory due to concurrent read/writes and also compete with user requests, specially if keys have large values e.g. `set`, `list` or any other multi-value type data.\\nDuring previous migration in `redis-cluster-ratelimiting`, a `BATCH_SIZE` of 30 was used and moving 1365 keyslots took less than [5 seconds](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18061#note_1924076365).\\nVariables that need to be replaced in command below are:\\n- `FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **from** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `TO_MASTER_NODE_ID`: node ID of master node **to** which keyslots are to be migrated\\n- `KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE`: number of keyslots to be migrated\\n- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of redis keys to be read and written from one master to another\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n# Trial runs to move some keyslots with batch size 30 to get time taken and its impact on CPU/Memory utilization\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nAt the same time, keep an eye on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. Also, note the time taken for migration of keyslots to estimate required time for completing the migration. If there is no impact on resources and time taken by migration is not reasonable, then try increasing the `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` to a workable number.\\n### 3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard\\n[Section titled “3. Migrate keys from existing shards to new shard”](#3-migrate-keys-from-existing-shards-to-new-shard)\\nWe have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster and a cluster with 3 shards have distribution like following:\\n1. First shard: 0-5460\\n2. Second shard: 5461-10922\\n3. Third shard: 10923-16383\\nIn this case, a new fourth shard will intake equal number of keyslots from all 3 existing shards, so 1365 keyslots from each (after round off).\\nOnce `<BATCH_SIZE>` and `<KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE>` have been determined, migrate the keyslots from each of existing shards to the new shard using:\\n```\\nssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\ntime sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_MASTER_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS_TO_MOVE> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n```\\nKeep a check on CPU/Memory saturation and Apdex violation metrics in Redis Cluster dashboard. If an impact becomes visible and migration needs to be stopped, the process can be killed (ctrl + c).\\nKilling a running migration will likely leave one migrating keyslot in a hanging state, where it might have some keys migrated to new master but some keys might still be on the previous master. The hanging keyslot can be fixed by running `--cluster fix` command as mentioned in the troubleshooting section below.\\n### 4. Troubleshooting\\n[Section titled “4. Troubleshooting”](#4-troubleshooting)\\n- If during migration, cluster configuration breaks for some reason (Redis process died or migration halted manually), then subsequent migrations will fail due to broken cluster state. Run the cluster fix command as follows, to recover from this situation:\\n```, cluster_slots_pfail:0\\ncluster_slots_fail:0\\ncluster_known_nodes:12\\ncluster_size:4\\n```\\n## Enable `debug` command on Redis Cluster\\n[Section titled “Enable debug command on Redis Cluster”](#enable-debug-command-on-redis-cluster)\\nAs mentioned in the beginning, most of the existing Redis Clusters do not have `debug` command enabled, which is needed to fix the cluster state as part of troubleshooting broken cluster.\\nThis step will enable the `debug` command by reconfiguring the existing Redis processes. Previous CR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18043).\\nRun this from chef-repo, to find the existing Redis servers and reconfigure them via `redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh` in the runbooks repository, excluding new shard as it was configured already with `enable-debug-command` above during provisioning.\\nCaution\\n`enable-debug-command` config option must already be enabled for newly added nodes during the time of provisioning otherwise failover wouldn’t work, which is required for reconfiguring the Redis process. Failover requires at least one keyslot to be present on the shard.\\nCaution\\nBefore running `scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh`, check the content of `$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt` for any `knife` logs, remove such lines if any.\\n```\\n# cd chef-repo\\nknife search -i \"roles:$ENV-base-db-$DEPLOYMENT\" | sort -V | grep -v $SHARD_NUMBER > /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n# cd runbooks\\nscripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n```\\n## Scale out cluster by resharding Redis keys\\n[Section titled “Scale out cluster by resharding Redis keys”](#scale-out-cluster-by-resharding-redis-keys)\\nThe goal here is to distribute the number of keyslots among all shards equally (With some rounding off). By default, we have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster. Until now, we just added Redis instances for new shard to the cluster, but they do not have any Redis keys (keyslots) yet and hence they are not serving any user requests.\\nIn this phase, we will migrate some keyslots from previous Redis shards to the new shard, so that new Redis instances start load sharing with existing Redis instances and hence lower their resource (CPU/Memory) utilization.

datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over.

[Section titled “Why partition?”](#why-partition) Redis is a (mostly) single threaded application and thus can only use one CPU. Some small amount of CPU can be offloaded to IO threads, but it is a small percentage. This means that we have a hard upper limit for CPU capacity for any specific redis instance. Partitioning allows us to get around this by splitting off part of the workload of an existing redis instance to a new, separate redis instance. We are tracking this in [capacity planning issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/), and should have a reasonable amount of warning if this needs to be done. In the longer term, we’re working on [redis cluster](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/823) to allow for horizontal scaling as well. The other reason to partition redis would be for workload isolation, and that is a reason that will become the more common scenario after we have a functional horizontal scaling system. ## Timing [Section titled “Timing”](#timing) The last two redis partitions that we have done took between 3 - 6 weeks to complete. The main factors that slow down or speed up the time required are the availability of reviewers for MRs, particularly for the application changes. In general, tamland forecasts capacity out approximately three months, which should give us adequate time to partition if required. ## Determining what to split off [Section titled “Determining what to split off”](#determining-what-to-split-off) This is more of an art than a science, as it will require some amount of knowledge of the usage patterns of the redis in question. We have documented how to [analyze memory usage](../redis#redis-memory-analyzer) as well as [keyspace usage and network traffic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/redis/redis.md#keyspace-pattern-analysis), all of which can be combined to help determine what the largest chunk that makes logical sense to move is. ## Implementation [Section titled “Implementation”](#implementation) A lot of these processes are still a work in progress and will be modified based off of the results of [the epic to lessen sharding toil](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/886). ## Application changes [Section titled “Application changes”](#application-changes) - Create a new redis store class. It should inherit from `Gitlab::Redis::Wrapper`. Configure its `config_fallback` to be the current store from which you’re sharding off this workload. - Add `use_primary_and_secondary_stores_for_<store_name>` and `use_primary_store_as_default_for_<store_name>` feature flags, matching the name of the new store. - Update the relevant client code to use the new store. [Example issue and MRs.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2149) ## Infrastructure changes [Section titled “Infrastructure changes”](#infrastructure-changes) With the [current k8s overhead due to the networking stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/16871), we can only migrate workloads that are expected to remain well under saturation threshold to Kubernetes. [See discussion points here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/2130). This means that in most cases, we’ll likely be functionally sharding off onto VMs, but I’ve included the k8s documentation for when we can shift to using that more. We presently do not have a well known method of creating a redis cluster shard, but that is work in progress as well. ### VMs [Section titled “VMs”](#vms) 1. [Create a chef role](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/blob/master/roles/gprd-base-db-redis-server-db-load-balancing.json) 2. [Provision in terraform](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/merge_requests/5009) 3. [Configure with redis-reconfigure.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/redis-reconfigure.sh) Step 1 and 2 will leave the cluster in a strange state, with each redis host believing they are the primary and a somewhat confused sentinel quorum. In order to get things back in order, you’ll need to run chef-client, gitlab-ctl reconfigure, and set each secondary to be a replica of the primary. The redis-reconfigure.sh script does this for you.

Direct Answer\\nMigration procedures for Redis sharding, including cluster setup and reconfiguration, are integral to maintaining high availability and performance during failover events. Properly executing resharding and reconfiguration ensures that hash slot ownership remains balanced and consistent, minimizing downtime and redirection errors. When Redis failover occurs, the cluster logs and redirection metrics (e.g., MOVED/ASK) help verify that clients are correctly redirected to new masters, maintaining data integrity and availability. Regular monitoring of master switch logs and redirection rates ensures that failovers are handled smoothly, and the cluster remains resilient.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2.

Cluster Setup & Reconfiguration\\n1. **Initialize the Cluster (if new):**\\n   - Follow the [official Redis guide](https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/#create-a-redis-cluster) to create a new cluster.\\n2. **Configure Nodes for Debugging (if troubleshooting):**\\n   - Reconfigure existing nodes to enable `debug` commands:\\n     ```\\n     cd chef-repo\\n     knife search -i \"roles:$ENV-base-db-$DEPLOYMENT\" | sort -V > /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n     cd runbooks\\n     scripts/redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh /tmp/$DEPLOYMENT-nodes.txt\\n     ```\\n3. **Perform Resharding (Scaling Out):**\\n   - Check current keyslot distribution:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n     ```\\n   - Determine target keyslots for migration.\\n   - Migrate keyslots:\\n     ```\\n     ssh $DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard 127.0.0.1:6379 --cluster-from <FROM_NODE_ID> --cluster-to <TO_NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <KEYSLOTS> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n     ```\\n   - Repeat for all keyslots to balance load.\\n\\n#### B. Handling Failover Events & Master Switch Logs\\n4. **Monitor Redirection Metrics:**\\n   - Track `cluster_redirection` errors (MOVED/ASK) via Grafana dashboards.\\n   - Observe `json.redis_<shard>_cross_slot_calls` to identify cross-slot errors.\\n5. **Verify Failover & Master Switches:**\\n   - Check logs for master switch events:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli --cluster info\\n     ```\\n   - Confirm `cluster_state:ok` and `cluster_slots_ok:16384`.\\n6. **Respond to Failover:**\\n   - If a master fails, Redis will promote a replica automatically.\\n   - If automatic failover fails, manually promote a replica:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n     ```\\n7. **Fix Broken Cluster State (if needed):**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix 127.0.0.1:6379\\n     ```\\n   - This repairs any hanging keyslots after failed migrations or node failures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Resharding:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster reshard <host:port> --cluster-from <NODE_ID> --cluster-to <NODE_ID> --cluster-slots <NUM> --cluster-pipeline <BATCH_SIZE> --cluster-yes\\n  ```\\n- **Fix Cluster State:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster fix <host:port>\\n  ```\\n- **Failover Promotion:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER\\n  ```\\n- **Check Cluster Info:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli --cluster info\\n  ```\\n- **Check Slot Distribution:**\\n  ```\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster slots\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:**\\n  - Ensure `debug` commands are enabled on nodes before troubleshooting.\\n  - Always monitor CPU/Memory and Apdex metrics during resharding to prevent resource saturation.\\n- **Warnings:**\\n  - Killing a migration process may leave keyslots in a hanging state; run `--cluster fix` afterward.\\n  - During failover, clients will receive redirection errors; these are normal and expected.\\n  - Resharding is a planned operation; avoid performing it during peak load unless necessary.\\n- **Additional Context:**\\n  - Regularly review master switch logs and redirection metrics to confirm high availability.\\n  - Use the cluster dashboard to monitor slot coverage and node health continuously.\\n  - Properly coordinate resharding and failover procedures to minimize service disruption.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis structured approach ensures that Redis sharding, cluster setup, and reconfiguration procedures are aligned with failover handling, maintaining high availability and optimal performance.                                                                                                                                                                   Migration procedures for Redis sharding, such as setting up clusters and reconfiguring nodes, are essential for distributing workload and achieving horizontal scaling, which directly impacts high availability and performance. Proper cluster setup ensures that Redis instances can failover seamlessly during failover events, with master switch logs providing critical information about role changes and failover occurrences. By combining effective sharding migration techniques with vigilant monitoring of master switch logs, infrastructure engineers can maintain Redis high availability, quickly respond to failover events, and optimize performance within complex infrastructure setups.      0.937500          0.826948           1.000000        1.000000            0.789339               0.090909\n",

By default, we have 16384 keyslots in a given Redis Cluster. Until now, we just added Redis instances for new shard to the cluster, but they do not have any Redis keys (keyslots) yet and hence they are not serving any user requests.\\nIn this phase, we will migrate some keyslots from previous Redis shards to the new shard, so that new Redis instances start load sharing with existing Redis instances and hence lower their resource (CPU/Memory) utilization.

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots., ```\\nUse the following command to connect the remaining nodes to the cluster. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..m}` where `n` is the number of shards and `m` is the number of instances per shard.\\n```\\nfor i in {01,02,03}-{02,03}; do\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\\\n$DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379 \\\\n$DEPLOYMENT-shard-01-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal:6379\\nsleep 2\\ndone\\n```\\nUse the following command, to assign the replicas within each shard. Update `{01, 02, 03, ... n}-{02,03,..n}` where necessary depending on the cluster-size.\\n```\\nfor i in {01,02,03}; do\\nfor j in {02,03}; do\\nnode_id=\"$(sudo gitlab-redis-cli cluster nodes | grep $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-01-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal | awk '{ print $1 }')\";\\nsudo gitlab-redis-cli -h $DEPLOYMENT-shard-$i-$j-db-$ENV.c.$PROJECT.internal \\\\ncluster replicate $node_id\\ndone\\ndone\\n```\\n### 5.

Previous CR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18043).\\nRun this from chef-repo, to find the existing Redis servers and reconfigure them via `redis-cluster-reconfigure.sh` in the runbooks repository, excluding new shard as it was configured already with `enable-debug-command` above during provisioning.\\nCaution, Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf)\\ninteractive:\\n```\\nREDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli\\n```\\nor oneliners:\\n```\\nREDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10\\n```\\n### Building a new Redis server and starting replication\\n[Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication)\\nNOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial>\\nFrom time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes.\\nSo, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take:\\n1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`\\n- This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel\\n2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel`\\n- Not sure why, but it’s minor\\n3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master:\\n1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2)\\n2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli\\n3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379\\n4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication\\nYou’re now expecting the replica to report something like:\\n```\\nrole:slave\\nmaster_host:MASTER_IP\\nmaster_port:6379\\n```\\nIf you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2`\\n#### Discussion\\n[Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion)\\nSentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status.\\nIt’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time.\\n### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)\\n[Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis)\\nsee: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md>\\n### Replication issues\\n[Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues)\\n#### Possible checks\\n[Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks)\\n#### client-output-buffer-limit\\n[Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit)\\ncheck Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf>\\nTerminal window\\n```\\n> config get client-output-buffer-limit\\n```\\n#### Checks Using Prometheus\\n[Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus)\\n##### Redis Primaries\\n[Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries)\\nList the Redis primaries using:\\n- [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1)\\n##### Redis Secondaries]  [<1-hop>\\n\\n[PatroniGCSSnapshotDelayed](/patroni/alerts/PatroniGCSSnapshotDelayed/) -

Managing from 1-hop and 2-hop info involves inspecting node and slot assignments, adding nodes, and ensuring cluster consistency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### 1. Prepare for Scaling\\n- Ensure `cluster_slots_pfail:0` and `cluster_slots_fail:0` (cluster is healthy).\\n- Confirm current cluster size and node info:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <any_node> cluster info\\n  ```\\n- Check existing slot assignments:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <any_node> cluster slots\\n  ```\\n\\n#### 2. Add New Nodes (from 1-hop info)\\n- SSH into an existing master node:\\n  ```bash\\n  ssh <existing-master-node>\\n  ```\\n- Export environment variables:\\n  ```bash\\n  export ENV=<your-env>\\n  export PROJECT=<your-gcp-project>\\n  export DEPLOYMENT=redis-cluster-<INSTANCE_TYPE>\\n  export SHARD_NUMBER=<shard-number>\\n  ```\\n- Add each new node to the cluster:\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\\\n  <new-node-fqdn>:6379 \\\\n  <existing-master-node>:6379\\n  ```\\n- For additional nodes in the same shard:\\n  ```bash\\n  for i in {02,03}; do\\n    sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node \\\\n    <new-node-$i>:6379 \\\\n    <existing-master-node>:6379\\n    sleep 2\\n  done\\n  ```\\n\\n#### 3. Resharding (from 1-hop info)\\n- Check current slot distribution:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <any_node> cluster slots\\n  ```\\n- Calculate how many slots to assign to new nodes for load balancing.\\n- Migrate slots from existing masters to new nodes:\\n  - Use `redis-trib` or `redis-cli --cluster reshard` commands (see Redis resharding guide).\\n  - Example (simplified):\\n    ```bash\\n    redis-cli --cluster reshard <any_node> --cluster-from <source-node-id> --cluster-to <target-node-id> --cluster-slots <number>\\n    ```\\n- Alternatively, manually migrate slots:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster reshard <any_node>\\n  ```\\n- Confirm slot assignment:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <any_node> cluster info\\n  ```\\n\\n#### 4. Manage from 2-hop info\\n- Use `cluster nodes` to get node IDs and roles:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <any_node> cluster nodes\\n  ```\\n- Use `cluster slaves <node_id>` to see replicas of a master.\\n- Verify cluster health:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <any_node> cluster info\\n  ```\\n- Check slot health:\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli -c -h <any_node> cluster slots\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Key Commands Summary\\n- **Add node to cluster:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster add-node <new-node>:6379 <existing-node>:6379\\n  ```\\n- **Assign replicas:**\\n  ```bash\\n  sudo gitlab-redis-cli --cluster replicate <node_id>\\n  ```\\n- **Reshard slots:**\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster reshard <any_node>\\n  ```\\n- **Check cluster info:**\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster info\\n  ```\\n- **Check slot distribution:**\\n  ```bash\\n  redis-cli --cluster slots\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n- **Prerequisites:** Ensure `enable-debug-command` is enabled if troubleshooting is needed.\\n- **Cluster health:** Always verify `cluster_state:ok` and `cluster_slots_ok:16384`.\\n- **Resharding caution:** Resharding can cause temporary load spikes; plan maintenance windows.\\n- **Node management:** Use `cluster nodes` and `cluster slaves` to monitor node roles and replicas.\\n- **From 2-hop info:** Use `cluster nodes` and `cluster slaves` to understand node relationships and health.\\n\\nThis process ensures a controlled, step-by-step scaling and management of your Redis Cluster from both 1-hop and 2-hop perspectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      to scale up redis cluster and manage nodes, you need to create or recreate clusters from snapshots as described in the 1-hop context, and also perform scaling, upgrades, and maintenance activities outlined in the 2-hop context, such as geo patroni cluster management and managing redis cluster features, ensuring proper provisioning and management of redis nodes.      0.752381          0.901222           1.000000        0.333333            0.864719               0.000000\n",

[primary fails (as determined by Sentinel), one of the replicas is promoted to primary.\\nClients are configured to connect to the sentinels which will then direct them to the current primary; there is no load\\nbalancer involved in this path. Failover is automatic (handled by Sentinel) and results in clients being disconnected\\nfrom the primary and then reconnecting via the sentinels again. It requires no operator intervention under normal circumstances\\nThe configuration is subtly different across the clusters, for historical reasons; the persistent and sidekiq clusters\\nhave sentinel running on the VMs alongside redis, whereas the cache cluster uses a distinct set of sentinel VMs.\\n<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11389> records the desire to clean this up.\\n### Node failure\\n[Section titled “Node failure”](#node-failure)\\nIf one or more replicas fail, nothing of note occurs to Redis availability. The primary continues to be the primary,\\nand any remaining replicas continue to replicate. We might receive various alerts (depending on the means of failure)\\nbut gitlab.com will remain operational. When the replicas come back online, they will be resynchronized with the primary\\nIf the primary fails, sentinel notices and actively manages the failover process, promoting a remaining replica to\\nprimary and re-establishing replication off the new primary. When the ex-primary comes back online, it will be reconfigured\\nas a replica by sentinel and pointed to the current primary.\\nIf all 3 nodes fail at once, everything grinds to a halt and gitlab.com will be down.\\n#### Slowness can cause failover\\n[Section titled “Slowness can cause failover”](#slowness-can-cause-failover)\\nAn important special case of a node being “down” is saturation-induced slowness.\\nExtremely slow response time from the Redis primary can cause Sentinel health checks to timeout, leading Sentinels\\nto force a failover. In this case, the old primary host and its redis-server process are still running, but\\nredis-server is being overwhelmed by its workload.\\nRedis handles its clients’ requests serially. Normally it is able to service all active clients’ requests\\nwith little delay. However, if the workload reaches the saturation point (100% of 1 vCPU), then a backlog of\\nclient requests can potentially accumulate.\\nRedis treats its Sentinels like any other client. Sentinels periodically send a cheap `PING` request, and if the\\nmonitored Redis instance does not respond within Sentinel’s configured timeout (`down-after-milliseconds` = 10 seconds),\\nthen that Sentinel considers the unresponsive Redis instance to be “subjectively down”. When a quorum of Sentinels\\nagree (2 of 3), that unresponsive Redis instance is considered “objectively down”. If that unresponsive node\\nis the primary and a majority of Sentinels are up, the Sentinels initiate a failover.\\nDuing such a slowness-induced failover event, it is possible for the overwhelming workload to follow the failover\\nto the new primary node. It takes time to recover the old primary as a working replica, and during that time it\\nis not treated as a failover candidate. So in a 3-node replication set, at most 2 failovers can occur in\\nrapid succession.\\nFor reference, historically we have observed a few patterns of client behavior that can lead to severe spikes\\nin Redis response time:\\n- *Periodic microbursts:* Large spikes of concurrent requests from many clients can induce CPU saturation.\\nWhen thousands of clients participate in such microbursts, the unlucky clients at the tail of the queue can\\nstall for several thousand of milliseconds. For example, this can happen when many clients synchronously expire\\ntheir local cached response to some very frequent Redis query (e.g. find which GitLab feature flags are enabled).\\n- *Large requests:* Some Redis operations can potentially be much more expensive than most (e.g. adding many elements\\nto a large set via a single atomic `SADD` request). Activity at higher layers in the application stack can\\nsometimes increase the frequency of these 10+ millisecond operations, implicitly causing response time spikes\\nfor other clients that have to wait in the queue.\\n### Network partition\\n[Section titled “Network partition”](#network-partition)\\nFor the clusters with sentinel on the VM alongside redis, a simple network partition results in 2 nodes thinking the 3rd\\nis down, and the 3rd node thinking the other 2 are down.\\nIf the primary is in the 2-node side, no failover will occur on Redis; when the partition resolves, the replica that was\\nalone will resynchronize replication., ```\\n$ /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n1)  1) \"name\"\\n2) \"gstg-redis-cache\"        # cluster_id\\n3) \"ip\"\\n4) \"10.224.8.103\"            # ip address of the current master\\n5) \"port\"\\n6) \"6379\"\\n7) \"runid\"\\n8) \"06277f7abca059c268b2c5e2b2581d7d3bf330f1\"\\n9) \"flags\"\\n10) \"master\"\\n11) \"link-pending-commands\"\\n12) \"0\"\\n13) \"link-refcount\"\\n14) \"1\"\\n15) \"last-ping-sent\"\\n16) \"0\"\\n17) \"last-ok-ping-reply\"\\n18) \"440\"\\n19) \"last-ping-reply\"\\n20) \"440\"\\n21) \"down-after-milliseconds\"\\n22) \"10000\"\\n23) \"info-refresh\"\\n24) \"9021\"\\n25) \"role-reported\"\\n26) \"master\"\\n27) \"role-reported-time\"\\n28) \"956691745\"\\n29) \"config-epoch\"\\n30) \"51\"\\n31) \"num-slaves\"\\n32) \"2\"\\n33) \"num-other-sentinels\"\\n34) \"2\"\\n35) \"quorum\"\\n36) \"2\"\\n37) \"failover-timeout\"\\n38) \"60000\"\\n39) \"parallel-syncs\"\\n40) \"1\"\\n```\\n1.

In cluster mode, there are no Sentinel sidecar processes to perform monitoring, routing, and failover. Instead, each Redis node communicates with all of its peers in a mesh, and clients are cluster-aware, connecting directly to these nodes. In addition to the standard port that clients use, Redis nodes also use a “cluster bus” gossip protocol (on standard port + 10000) to exchange messages about cluster config updates, failure detection, failover authorization, etc. (see all gossip message types).\\n**shard**:In Redis Cluster, a shard is a discrete set of hash slots (defined below), owned by a group of Redis nodes (a master node and its replicas). In some discussions we have alternately called this a “replica set”, to distinguish it from our historical use of the term “shard” to represent client-managed “functional partitions” (where clients send certain keys to purpose-specific Redis targets such as `redis-sidekiq`, `redis-tracechunks`, etc.).\\n**node**: A single redis-server process, acting in either a master or replica role. A Redis Cluster consists of a set of such nodes. The cluster aims to have every hash slot owned by exactly 1 master (many-to-one), and each replica replicates the entirety of a single master (using the same async replication mechanism as with our current Sentinel-managed Redis nodes). The cluster can dynamically reassign a node’s role to compensate for node or connectivity failures, with the goal of ensuring that all hash slots are assigned to a healthy master node and all master nodes have a target number of replicas.\\n**hash slot**: The smallest unit of sharding. Every Redis Cluster has exactly 16384 hash slots. Groups of hash slots are assigned as non-overlapping ranges to Redis master nodes (and their replicas). Example:\\n```\\nMaster[0] -> Slots 0 - 5460\\nMaster[1] -> Slots 5461 - 10922\\nMaster[2] -> Slots 10923 - 16383\\n```\\nRedis determines which shard stores a key by mapping that key to a hash slot using the [crc16 hash of the key or its hash](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0.7/src/cluster.c#L927-L952) tag and then checking which master node owns that hash slot. The dictionary mapping hash slots to master nodes is locally cached by clients, and if a client’s cached dictionary becomes out of date, Redis will redirect the client to the appropriate node, allowing the client to update its dictionary for future operations.\\n**cross-slot operations**: Multi-key commands containing keys which map to different hash slots. Any operations involving keys of different hash slot are deemed unsafe by Redis Cluster and rejected. For example, an `MGET` for keys of different hash slot is not possible to be served by a single master node since it may not own all the required hash slots.]

[Section titled “Is redis running?”](#is-redis-running) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana) Grafana dashboards: - [redis](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-main/redis-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-cache](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sidekiq](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-tracechunks](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-tracechunks-main/redis-tracechunks-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-ratelimiting](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-ratelimiting-main/redis-ratelimiting-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) - [redis-sessions](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sessions-main/redis-sessions-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) For example, there is a Grafana chart showing number of slowlog events in redis-sidekiq (not linking it here because the panel ID changes when Grafana dashboards are deployed). ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos) <https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1w&g0.expr=redis_up%20%3C%201&g0.tab=0> ### directly on a redis host [Section titled “directly on a redis host”](#directly-on-a-redis-host) - is redis up? - `gitlab-ctl status` - can we dial redis? - `telnet localhost 6379` - can we talk to redis via `redis-cli`? ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli info ``` ## How to get redis stats? [Section titled “How to get redis stats?”](#how-to-get-redis-stats) ### Grafana [Section titled “Grafana”](#grafana-1) [see above](#grafana) ### Prometheus/Thanos [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos”](#prometheusthanos-1) Redis hosts are running the `redis_exporter` . It is scraped by Prometheus. See [the exporter documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) for more details. [Example `redis_exporter` metric](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=redis_commands_processed_total&g0.tab=1) in Thanos. ### redis-cli [Section titled “redis-cli”](#redis-cli) Run: - [INFO command](https://redis.io/commands/info) - [MEMORY\\_STATS command](https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats) NOTE: DO NOT USE [MONITOR] COMMAND! It streams back every command processed by the Redis server which can double the use of resources. It can overload a production machine making it unresponsive or causing an OOM kill. NOTE: DO NOT USE [KEYS] COMMAND! It will overload a production machine. ## What is causing Redis to slowdown? [Section titled “What is causing Redis to slowdown?”](#what-is-causing-redis-to-slowdown) The application relies on Redis throughput to be very high, latency spikes can be detrimental to the operation of the entire application. ### Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana [Section titled “Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana”](#prometheusthanosgrafana) Explore Prometheus/Thanos/Grafana. Historical metrics might suggest a sudden change in the application behavior or traffic, for example: - operations rate, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=54> - keys rate of change, 7d: <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-cache-main/redis-cache-overview?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=64> For Grafana links [see above](#grafana). ### slowlog [Section titled “slowlog”](#slowlog) The slowlog records slow Redis queries. Redis [SLOWLOG command documentation](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog). Get top 10 Redis slowlog entries: Terminal window ``` > slowlog get 10 1) 1) (integer) 5100 # A unique progressive identifier for every slow log entry. 2) (integer) 1561019091 # The unix timestamp at which the logged command was processed. 3) (integer) 21390 # The amount of time needed for its execution, in microseconds. 4) 1) \"del\" # The array composing the arguments of the command. 2) \"cache:gitlab:242234:8213877:Ci::CompareTestReportsService\" ``` To convert the timestamp, use `date -d @1561019091`. Get the command execution time threshold at which commands are logged (in microseconds): ``` > config get slowlog-log-slower-than ``` Get size of slowlog (entries are discarded like in a FIFO queue): ``` > config get slowlog-max-len ``` #### Monitoring number of slowlog entries [Section titled “Monitoring number of slowlog entries”](#monitoring-number-of-slowlog-entries) The number of entries added to the slowlog is exposed as a Prometheus metric and [there is a Grafana chart for it](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-sidekiq-main/redis-sidekiq-overview?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now&fullscreen&panelId=48). #### Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog [Section titled “Monitoring the rate of change in the slowlog”](#monitoring-the-rate-of-change-in-the-slowlog) A useful metric for monitoring potential slow-downs in Redis is measuring the rate of change in the `redis_slowlog_last_id`. This can be done by plotting (`changes(redis_slowlog_last_id[1h])`](../<https://prometheus.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1d&g0.expr=changes(redis_slowlog_last_id%5B1h%5D)&g0.tab=0>). ### Redis latency monitoring framework [Section titled “Redis latency monitoring framework”](#redis-latency-monitoring-framework) Redis provides a latency diagnostic tool: <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> You may need to enable it with `CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100`. From <https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor> : By default monitoring is disabled (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. However while the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well. #### LATENCY DOCTOR [Section titled “LATENCY DOCTOR”](#latency-doctor) Terminal window ``` > CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100 > LATENCY DOCTOR Dave, I have observed latency spikes in this Redis instance. You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave? 1. command: 5 latency spikes (average 300ms, mean deviation 120ms, period 73.40 sec). Worst all time event 500ms. I have a few advices for you: - Your current Slow Log configuration only logs events that are slower than your configured latency monitor threshold. Please use 'CONFIG, <2-hop>\\n\\npresented are an optimistic estimate, as redis will require some more memory for its datastructures. Generally, the key size will be on that order of magnitude. The current `maxmemory` in Redis-cache is set to `60 GiB`. Depending on the numbers you get, the ratio of each compared to the `maxmemory` can give you an idea of how significant of an impact your change might introduce. **Please remember to delete the RDB file once you’re done!** Terminal window ``` rm $RDB_FILE_PATH/dump.rdb ``` #### Please remember to delete the `pcap` file immediately after performing the analysis [Section titled “Please remember to delete the pcap file immediately after performing the analysis”](#please-remember-to-delete-the-pcap-file-immediately-after-performing-the-analysis) ### CPU profiling [Section titled “CPU profiling”](#cpu-profiling) CPU profiles are useful for diagnosing CPU saturation. Especially since redis is (mostly) single-threaded, CPU can become a bottleneck. A profile can be captured via perf: Terminal window ``` sudo mkdir -p /var/log/perf-$USER cd /var/log/perf-$USER sudo chown $USER:$USER . sudo perf record -p $(pidof redis-server) -F 497 --call-graph dwarf --no-inherit -- sleep 300 sudo perf script --header | gzip > stacks.$(hostname).$(date --iso-8601=seconds).gz sudo rm perf.data ``` This will sample stacks at ~500hz. Those stack traces can then be downloaded and analyzed with [flamescope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope) or [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Terminal window ``` scp $host:/var/log/perf-\\*/stacks.\\*.gz . cat stacks.$host.$time.gz | gunzip - | ~/code/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/code/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg ``` ### Accessing Redis via the Rails console [Section titled “Accessing Redis via the Rails console”](#accessing-redis-via-the-rails-console) Sometimes you may wish to query a production Redis server from a Rails console. Either because you don’t have sufficient access to run `redis-cli`, or because you are running a query that is easier expressed in Ruby than with `redis-cli`. You probably want to use a Redis secondary to do this. This is how you instantiate a Ruby Redis client for a secondary: ``` redis = Redis.new(Gitlab::Redis::SharedState.params.merge(role: :slave)) ``` Substitute `Cache`,`Queues`, `TraceChunks`, `RateLimiting`, or `Sessions` for ‘SharedState’ to get a client for the respective Redis instance. ### packetbeat [Section titled “packetbeat”](#packetbeat) TODO <https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/packetbeat> ### Profiling the application [Section titled “Profiling the application”](#profiling-the-application) TODO e.g. rbspy, will be partially covered by <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6940> ## Failover and Recovery procedures [Section titled “Failover and Recovery procedures”](#failover-and-recovery-procedures) ### Accessing the Redis console [Section titled “Accessing the Redis console”](#accessing-the-redis-console) Be extremely careful with Redis! There are commands such as KEYS or MONITOR that can lock Redis entirely without any warning. The application relies heavily on cache so locking Redis will result in an immediate downtime. Redis admin password is stored in the omnibus cookbook secrets in GKMS, and it’s deployed to gitlab config file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (this file then gets translated into multiple other config files, including redis.conf) interactive: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli ``` or oneliners: ``` REDISCLI_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\\" -f2) /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli slowlog get 10 ``` ### Building a new Redis server and starting replication [Section titled “Building a new Redis server and starting replication”](#building-a-new-redis-server-and-starting-replication) NOTE: These instructions are for setting up Redis *Sentinel*: <https://redis.io/topics/sentinel> . NOT for setting up Redis *Cluster*: <https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial> From time to time you may have to build (or rebuild) a redis cluster. While the omnibus documentation (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/redis.html>) says everything should start replicating by magic, it doesn’t in our builds because we touch /etc/gitlab/skip-autoreconfigure on redis nodes, so that restarts during upgrades can be done in a more controlled fashion across multiple nodes. So, after building the nodes, there are some manual steps to take: 1. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` - This will reconfigure/start up redis, but not sentinel 2. On all nodes, `sudo gitlab-ctl start sentinel` - Not sure why, but it’s minor 3. On the replicas, start replicating from the master: 1. REDISCLI\\_AUTH=$(sudo grep ^masterauth /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf|cut -d\\” -f2) 2. /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli 3. 127.0.0.1:6379> slaveof MASTER\\_IP 6379 4. 127.0.0.1:6379> info replication You’re now expecting the replica to report something like: ``` role:slave master_host:MASTER_IP master_port:6379 ``` If you run `info replication` on the master, you expect to see `role:master` and `connected_slaves:2` #### Discussion [Section titled “Discussion”](#discussion) Sentinel is supposed to control the replication configuration in redis.conf (the ‘slaveof’ configuration line); therefore, when omnibus creates redis.conf it really shouldn’t add that configuration line, otherwise it and sentinel would end up fighting. So new redis nodes created with omnibus installed will all think they’re master, until they’re told otherwise. We do this above, and at that point, sentinel (connected to the master) becomes aware of the replicas, and starts managing their replication status. It’s a little chicken-and-egg, and humans need to be involved. It should, however, be one-off at cluster build time. ### Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis) [Section titled “Ban an IP with Rails Rack Attack (which uses redis)”](#ban-an-ip-with-rails-rack-attack-which-uses-redis) see: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/docs/redis/ban-an-IP-with-redis.md> ### Replication issues [Section titled “Replication issues”](#replication-issues) #### Possible checks [Section titled “Possible checks”](#possible-checks) #### client-output-buffer-limit [Section titled “client-output-buffer-limit”](#client-output-buffer-limit) check Redis docs for more information: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/redis.conf> Terminal window ``` > config get client-output-buffer-limit ``` #### Checks Using Prometheus [Section titled “Checks Using Prometheus”](#checks-using-prometheus) ##### Redis Primaries [Section titled “Redis Primaries”](#redis-primaries) List the Redis primaries using: - [`redis_master_repl_offset > 0`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_master_repl_offset%20%3E%200%20&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Secondaries [Section titled “Redis Secondaries”](#redis-secondaries) List the Redis secondaries using: - [`redis_slave_info`](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=redis_slave_info&g0.tab=1) ##### Redis Replication Lag [Section titled “Redis Replication Lag”](#redis-replication-lag) Replication lag indicates that the Redis secondaries are struggling to keep up with the changes on the primary. This may be due to the rate of changes on the primary being too high, or the secondaries being under too much load to keep up. Replication lag is measured in bytes in the replication stream. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=13&fullscreen&orgId=1> ##### Redis Replication Events [Section titled “Redis Replication Events”](#redis-replication-events) - Check the Redis Replication Events dashboard to see if Redis is frequently failing over. This may indicate replication issues. <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/andrew-redis?panelId=14&fullscreen&orgId=1> - Master switch events are logged in the redis log, for example: Terminal window ``` $ zcat /var/log/gitlab/redis/@400000005e58927932f8744c.s | grep -i master 2020-02-27_11:35:39.68552 26796:M 27 Feb 2020 11:35:39.685 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request from 'id=267 addr=10.224.8.122:51379 fd=17 name= age=58518 idle=0 flags=x db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=3 qbuf=140 qbuf-free=32628 obl=36 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=exec') ``` #### Redis Sentinel [Section titled “Redis Sentinel”](#redis-sentinel)]  ### 1. Direct Answer\\nFailover and recovery procedures are essential in troubleshooting Redis slowdown causes and replication issues because they help identify, isolate, and restore Redis availability and performance. Failover procedures ensure that a healthy replica is promoted to primary when the current primary is overwhelmed or unresponsive, preventing prolonged downtime. Recovery procedures, such as resynchronizing replicas or addressing network partitions, help restore replication health and data consistency, which are critical for diagnosing performance bottlenecks and replication lag issues.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\\n\\n#### A. Troubleshooting Redis Slowdown Using Failover and Recovery Procedures\\n1. **Monitor Redis Health and Metrics**\\n   - Check Redis metrics via Grafana, Prometheus, or `redis-cli info`.\\n   - Look for high latency, slowlog entries, or high CPU/memory usage.\\n\\n2. **Identify Symptoms of Slowdown**\\n   - Confirm if Redis is responding slowly or timing out.\\n   - Check for saturation (CPU, memory, network).\\n\\n3. **Check Sentinel Status**\\n   - Run:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n     ```\\n   - Verify if Sentinel considers the primary \"subjectively down\" (no response within `down-after-milliseconds`).\\n\\n4. **Initiate Failover if Necessary**\\n   - If the primary is unresponsive or overwhelmed, manually trigger failover:\\n     ```\\n     /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover CLUSTER_NAME\\n     ```\\n   - Replace `CLUSTER_NAME` with your specific cluster (e.g., `gprd-redis-cache`).\\n\\n5. **Observe Failover Process**\\n   - Monitor Sentinel logs (`/var/log/gitlab/sentinel/current`) for failover events.\\n   - Confirm a new primary is elected and replicas are reconfigured.\\n\\n6. **Assess Replication Health**\\n   - Check replica synchronization status:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli info replication\\n     ```\\n   - Look for `master_sync_in_progress`, replication lag, or output buffer limits.\\n\\n7. **Address Underlying Causes**\\n   - If slowdown was caused by saturation:\\n     - Investigate workload spikes, large requests, or microbursts.\\n     - Consider optimizing queries or increasing resources.\\n   - If replication issues persist:\\n     - Check network connectivity.\\n     - Review logs for errors like `OOMKiller` or snapshot failures.\\n     - Reconfigure or restart Redis if needed.\\n\\n8. **Recover from Network Partitions or Flapping**\\n   - When network partitions are resolved, Redis nodes will resynchronize automatically.\\n   - Use:\\n     ```\\n     redis-cli -p <port> SENTINEL failover <master_name>\\n     ```\\n     if manual intervention is needed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Key Commands\\n- **Check Sentinel Masters:**\\n  ```\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n  ```\\n- **Trigger Failover Manually:**\\n  ```\\n  /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover CLUSTER_NAME\\n  ```\\n- **Check Replication Info:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli info replication\\n  ```\\n- **Check Redis Slowlog:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -a <password> slowlog get 10\\n  ```\\n- **Resynchronize Replicas (if needed):**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -a <password> --cluster reshard <host>:<port>\\n  ```\\n- **Adjust `client-output-buffer-limit` temporarily:**\\n  ```\\n  redis-cli -a <password> config set client-output-buffer-limit \"slave 4294967296 4294967296 0\"\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Important Notes\\n- **Precautions:**\\n  - Be cautious when manually triggering failover; it can cause temporary data unavailability.\\n  - Avoid running commands like `KEYS` or `MONITOR` in production, as they can lock Redis.\\n  - Ensure you have proper backups before making configuration changes or performing recovery steps.\\n- **Prerequisites:**\\n  - Access to Sentinel and Redis CLI with appropriate permissions.\\n  - Knowledge of current cluster configuration and roles.\\n- **Additional Context:**\\n  - Failover procedures are designed to minimize downtime but may temporarily impact performance.\\n  - Regular monitoring and alerting help preempt issues before failover becomes necessary.\\n  - Address root causes of slowdown (e.g., workload spikes, resource constraints) to prevent repeated failovers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nFailover and recovery procedures are vital tools for diagnosing and mitigating Redis slowdown and replication issues. They enable quick response to unresponsive or overwhelmed nodes, ensuring high availability and aiding in pinpointing underlying performance bottlenecks. Proper use of Sentinel commands, monitoring, and cautious intervention help maintain Redis health and stability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Failover and recovery procedures are essential for addressing redis slowdown causes and replication issues by ensuring that Redis can quickly switch to a healthy master if the current one fails, and by restoring replication links. These procedures include building new Redis servers, starting replication with 'slaveof' commands, and using Sentinel to manage automatic failover. Properly executing these steps helps maintain high availability, reduces latency spikes, and resolves replication problems, thereby improving Redis performance and stability.      0.541667          0.956240           1.000000        1.000000            0.379266               0.200000\n",
