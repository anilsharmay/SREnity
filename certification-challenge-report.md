## 1. Problem & Audience

### Problem Statement
**SREs waste critical time searching through runbooks during production incidents, leading to extended MTTR and increased business impact.**

### Target Audience: Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)

**Primary Users**: Site Reliability Engineers responding to production incidents who need immediate access to troubleshooting procedures, configuration commands, and incident response protocols.

**Job Function Automation**: Automating the manual process of searching through documentation, runbooks, and knowledge bases during high-pressure incident response scenarios.

### Why This is a Critical Problem for SREs

Production incidents demand immediate, accurate responses, but SREs currently face significant challenges:

**Time-Critical Knowledge Access**: During infrastructure failures (Redis, Elasticsearch, Cloud SQL, etc.), SREs must quickly locate the right troubleshooting steps from hundreds of runbook pages. Traditional documentation navigation is slow and error-prone when every minute counts.

**Knowledge Fragmentation**: Critical procedures are scattered across multiple runbooks, requiring SREs to search through GitLab documentation, internal wikis, and team knowledge bases simultaneously. This creates knowledge gaps and inconsistent response procedures across team members.

**High-Pressure Decision Making**: When production is down, SREs need instant access to specific commands, configuration changes, and escalation procedures. Manual runbook navigation under pressure leads to mistakes, missed steps, and extended resolution times.

### Certification Challenge Scope: Redis-Focused Implementation

**For this certification challenge, I demonstrate the SREnity approach using Redis-specific incident scenarios:**

**Typical Redis SRE Questions During Incidents**:
- "How do I restart Redis service without losing data?"
- "What's the Redis failover procedure for this cluster?"
- "How do I check Redis memory usage and optimize it?"
- "What are the Redis configuration parameters for high availability?"
- "How do I troubleshoot Redis connection timeouts?"
- "What's the procedure for Redis cluster scaling during peak traffic?"

**Note**: This Redis-focused scope demonstrates the core SREnity methodology and can be extended to cover all infrastructure components in the full implementation.

## 2. Solution Design

### Proposed Solution

**The Better World for SREs**: Instead of frantically searching through multiple runbook pages during a Redis outage, SREs will have an intelligent assistant that instantly understands their incident context and provides step-by-step guidance. When a Redis connection timeout occurs at 2 AM, the SRE simply asks "Redis connection timeout" and receives immediate, actionable procedures with specific commands, prerequisites, and escalation paths.

**How It Works**: SREnity combines advanced retrieval techniques with agentic reasoning to automatically find relevant runbook procedures, synthesize information from multiple sources, and present clear, actionable guidance. The system understands context, asks clarifying questions when needed, and provides both immediate fixes and preventive measures.

### Technical Architecture

#### Core Components:
1. **Advanced Retrieval Pipeline**: Ensemble approach combining vector similarity and BM25+reranking
2. **Agentic Reasoning**: LangGraph-based ReAct pattern for tool selection and response synthesis
3. **Knowledge Base**: GitLab SRE runbooks processed and indexed for semantic search
4. **Web Integration**: Tavily search for latest updates and CVE information
5. **Guardrails**: Reject all off-topic queries

#### Technology Stack with Justifications:

- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4.1 nano - Fast, economical, excellent instruction following and tool calling
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small - Economical, pairs well with gpt-4.1-nano
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant - High-performance similarity search optimized for large-scale document retrieval
- **Retrieval**: Ensemble Retriever combing BM25 + Cohere Rerank  and Naive retrievers - Combines keyword precision with semantic understanding for comprehensive coverage
- **Orchestration**: LangChain - Mature ecosystem with robust RAG pipeline management and tool integration
- **Agent Framework**: LangGraph - Advanced agentic reasoning with ReAct pattern for tool selection and response synthesis
- **Frontend**: Streamlit - Rapid deployment with professional UI optimized for incident response workflows
- **Evaluation**: RAGAS - Comprehensive framework for measuring retrieval quality and response accuracy

### Agent Usage and Reasoning
SREnity employs agentic reasoning through a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern:
- **Reasoning**: Analyzes input context and determines appropriate tools
- **Acting**: Executes runbook search and web search tools
- **Synthesis**: Combines retrieved information into actionable guidance

The Agent detects if the query can be answered using the runbook corpus. If yes, invokes ```search_runbook``` tool. If the query is about latest updates, CVEs, or version-specific issues, it uses ```search_web``` tool instead. Any off-topic queries not related to SRE operations are rejected as out of domain queries.
