## Write a succinct 1-sentence description of the problem

During high-severity incidents, SREs and engineers lose critical time analyzing logs across multiple tiers, correlating cross-system errors, and searching through fragmented runbooks, prolonging MTTR and amplifying business impact when every second counts.

## Write 1-2 paragraphs on why this is a problem for your specific user

For Site Reliability Engineers, every production outage is a race against the clock. When a P1 alert hits, the difference between minutes and hours can mean millions in lost revenue or reputation damage. Yet, SREs must sift through endless log lines, correlate symptoms across web, application, and database layers, and guess which signal represents the true root cause. Traditional monitoring tools show symptoms in isolation, while documentation and runbooks live in disconnected silos. Under pressure, context switching becomes constant, and valuable minutes slip away before the real issue is even identified.

This fragmented workflow doesn't just delay recovery—it burns out engineers. The on-call experience becomes a high-stress exercise in detective work rather than efficient response. The absence of cross-system intelligence leads to missed correlations, repeated incidents, and inconsistent outcomes depending on who's on call. The result: longer MTTR, higher operational risk, and preventable business impact.
